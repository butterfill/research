<div class="moz-text-flowed">Dear Steve
<br>
<br>Thanks for your question. I think it's an important question. Let me try to say briefly a few things. (I am sending this to Nick too, because one of our discussions during the conference was on what I take to be the same issue. Hi Nick.)
<br>
<br>As I said in my talk, the notion of innateness seems to be used to track various theoretically interesting properties and one interesting (empirical) issue is the extent to which these properties cluster. If the properties do cluster, then one can plausibly argue that the notion of innateness refers to the cluster. If the properties don't cluster, then one can try to show that one of these properties (or the conjunction of two or more of these properties) is explanatorily more fundamental than the other properties (than the other possible conjunctions). And if this fails, then one should probably eliminate innateness-talk from science.
<br>
<br>But whether or not one ends up eliminating innateness-talk, many of the properties that people infer to and from attributions of innateness are certainly properties that one needs to refer to in order to formulate good developmental theories, explanations, etc. Lack of learning is one such property. 

<br>For cognitive structures like those that you mention in your message, it is always interesting/important to understand what role (if any) learning in general or learning of this or that particular kind plays or does not play in their development. For example, the most interesting aspect of Chomsky's arguments for the innateness of UG are, in my opinion, those aimed at showing that Skinnerian learning and unconstrained hypothesis testing are not powerful and reliable enough to be able to result in the acquisition of the ability to speak and understand a standard (non-pidgin) human language. The same applies to Fodor's arguments for the innateness of lexical concepts. 

<br>Of course, Chomsky and Fodor want to argue for the much stronger conclusion that no learning of any kind is involved, respectively, in the development of the language faculty and in the development of lexical concepts. But their being able to reach this conclusion depends in part on whether their very restrictive views on what counts as learning are correct or not. If you look for example at some of the debates between Fodor and some connectionists (e.g. Elman et al.), it looks as if one of the crucial disagreements is about where to draw the line between learning and mere "maturation". Both the connectionists and Fodor take this to be a substantive issue rather than a mere terminological one, and they may be right in doing so, even though I suspect that the divide between learning and mere maturational processes is much less sharp than both Fodor and his connectionist opponents tend to assume. See also the anti-Chomskyian arguments that Tomasello puts forward in his recent book on language acquisition.
<br>
<br>What does this have to do with your question about levels of innateness? It seems to me that the connection is relatively clear. It looks as if there are cognitive structures whose development depends on very simple interactions with the environment. When these structures develop, more complex interactions with the environment become possible, and sometimes these more complex ways of interacting with the environment result in the development of even more complex structures, and so on. So, there clearly are levels in cognitive development. It is not clear whether these levels should be classified as levels of innateness. And it is not even clear whether these levels should be classified as levels of learning complexity (from simple learning processes to learning processes that involve explicit conscious reflection, etc.). But the levels are there, as your example shows. 

<br>It seems to me that the question concerning the right way to think about these levels is one of the most important questions in the foundations of the cognitive sciences. The debate between Fodor and the connectionists that Nick discussed in his talk in Geneva is just one aspect of (and one, relatively parochial, way of looking at) this important issue. 

<br>I have had for a long time wanted to write a paper on this. So, I'd be very happy to exchange ideas on this.
<br>
<br>Best,

<br>
<br>Thanks for emailing, I thought your talk was brilliant, both the general 
approach and the substance and I'm very interested to know more.&nbsp; I was 
especially struck by your emphasis on the point that need to have a 
deep, potentially explanatory characterisation of innateness rather than 
a merely stipulative definition. 

<br>My question is whether you think there is a way to recognise degrees or 
perhaps even levels of innateness (you mentioned Samuels 2004 paper in 
TICS which I think hints at this idea). 

<br>I'm motivated to ask this question by the following sort of situation.&nbsp; 
Johnson and Morton claim that there are two systems connected with the 
recognition of face vs. non-face stimuli.&nbsp; The first, conspec, is 
present at birth and supports orienting to face-like stimuli.&nbsp; The 
second, conlearn, develops in the first 2 months or so and supports the 
smooth tracking of faces and is more sophisticated in how it recognises 
faces.&nbsp; Since the development of conlearn depends on experience there's 
a fairly clear sense in which it is not innate.&nbsp; However, I suppose it 
might be plausible think of 'innate' as contrasting with 'learnt'.&nbsp; And 
although I suppose there is some sense in which the development of 
conlearn involves learning from experience, equally it seems to me that 
when theorising about capacities that involve more reflective learning 
such as, say, abilities to categorise familiar people by kinship 
relation, it is natural to take face recognition to be an innate 
capacity--or, rather, as a more innate capacity--partly because face 
recognition involves unreflective learning and partly because it seems 
to provide a foundation for the subsequent learning about things like 
kinship. 

<br>best,
<br>Steve

<br>It was very good seeing you in Geneva. I'm sorry we didn't find the 
time to talk more. You said you had a question re my talk. You might 
have forgotten it. But if you haven't, I would like to hear it.
<br>
<br>All very best,
