Dear Steve

Thanks for your question. I think it's an important question. Let me try to=
 say briefly a few things. (I am sending this to Nick too, because one of o=
ur discussions during the conference was on what I take to be the same issu=
e. Hi Nick.)

As I said in my talk, the notion of innateness seems to be used to track va=
rious theoretically interesting properties and one interesting (empirical) =
issue is the extent to which these properties cluster. If the properties do=
 cluster, then one can plausibly argue that the notion of innateness refers=
 to the cluster. If the properties don't cluster, then one can try to show =
that one of these properties (or the conjunction of two or more of these pr=
operties) is explanatorily more fundamental than the other properties (than=
 the other possible conjunctions). And if this fails, then one should proba=
bly eliminate innateness-talk from science.

But whether or not one ends up eliminating innateness-talk, many of the pro=
perties that people infer to and from attributions of innateness are certai=
nly properties that one needs to refer to in order to formulate good develo=
pmental theories, explanations, etc. Lack of learning is one such property.=
=20

For cognitive structures like those that you mention in your message, it is=
 always interesting/important to understand what role (if any) learning in =
general or learning of this or that particular kind plays or does not play =
in their development. For example, the most interesting aspect of Chomsky's=
 arguments for the innateness of UG are, in my opinion, those aimed at show=
ing that Skinnerian learning and unconstrained hypothesis testing are not p=
owerful and reliable enough to be able to result in the acquisition of the =
ability to speak and understand a standard (non-pidgin) human language. The=
 same applies to Fodor's arguments for the innateness of lexical concepts.=
=20

Of course, Chomsky and Fodor want to argue for the much stronger conclusion=
 that no learning of any kind is involved, respectively, in the development=
 of the language faculty and in the development of lexical concepts. But th=
eir being able to reach this conclusion depends in part on whether their ve=
ry restrictive views on what counts as learning are correct or not. If you =
look for example at some of the debates between Fodor and some connectionis=
ts (e.g. Elman et al.), it looks as if one of the crucial disagreements is =
about where to draw the line between learning and mere "maturation". Both t=
he connectionists and Fodor take this to be a substantive issue rather than=
 a mere terminological one, and they may be right in doing so, even though =
I suspect that the divide between learning and mere maturational processes =
is much less sharp than both Fodor and his connectionist opponents tend to =
assume. See also the anti-Chomskyian arguments that Tomasello puts forward =
in his recent book on language acquisition.

What does this have to do with your question about levels of innateness? It=
 seems to me that the connection is relatively clear. It looks as if there =
are cognitive structures whose development depends on very simple interacti=
ons with the environment. When these structures develop, more complex inter=
actions with the environment become possible, and sometimes these more comp=
lex ways of interacting with the environment result in the development of e=
ven more complex structures, and so on. So, there clearly are levels in cog=
nitive development. It is not clear whether these levels should be classifi=
ed as levels of innateness. And it is not even clear whether these levels s=
hould be classified as levels of learning complexity (from simple learning =
processes to learning processes that involve explicit conscious reflection,=
 etc.). But the levels are there, as your example shows.=20

It seems to me that the question concerning the right way to think about th=
ese levels is one of the most important questions in the foundations of the=
 cognitive sciences. The debate between Fodor and the connectionists that N=
ick discussed in his talk in Geneva is just one aspect of (and one, relativ=
ely parochial, way of looking at) this important issue.=20

I have had for a long time wanted to write a paper on this. So, I'd be very=
 happy to exchange ideas on this.

Best,
Matteo
