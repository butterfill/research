<DIV><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Steve (only) - thanks, this is really 
exciting and I'm confident now we can come up with something good.&nbsp;I'm 
now&nbsp;updating my proposal draft on the basis of your notes but it won't be 
ready to circulate before our lunch.&nbsp;That won't&nbsp;matter as there's 
plenty to discuss.&nbsp;One thing I'm stuck on and would like to discuss 
tomorrow is: if we agree that seeking help is necessarily reflective (and maybe 
we shouldn't), then how do we characterise the differences between easier and 
apparently harder kinds of asking:</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>1. Asking a question as a 2 year old 
"what's that?"&nbsp; - sometimes just used as a conversational device rather 
than as a genuine request to fill a gap in knowledge.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>2. Asking as a last resort having 
failed autonomously "which one is&nbsp;it?" - one step up from looking 
helpless</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>3. Asking when given the forced choice 
as in our tunnel expt "Please tell me" - having predicted that it is necessary 
to gain information from an indirect source. I assume whatever understanding is 
required will be the same as for consulting a symbol (proposed expt 
2).</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>And if we do classify all these as 
demanding reflective understanding, how do they map on to their equivalent 
see/feel counterparts and would <EM>those</EM> be considered to tap only working 
understanding?&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>1. The first might be exploratory 
feeling/ looking</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>2. Might be spontaneous self-correction 
after choosing to look in the tunnel to find out whether the toy is hard or 
soft</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>(and in proposed Expt 1 we see if 
asking happens after taking uninformative direct access)</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>3. Should be equivalent to predicting 
whether you need to see or feel. </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>What I'm hoping is that we can use the 
contrast between understanding about direct sources and understanding 
about&nbsp; indirect sources as a neat route into clarifying the 
working-reflective distinction in a way that would either in principle be 
generalizable to other cases, or would enable us to&nbsp;argue why it's 
misleading to try and produce a single developmental account of 
implicit-explicit understanding....</FONT></DIV>
