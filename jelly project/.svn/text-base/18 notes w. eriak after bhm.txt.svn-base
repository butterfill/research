Steve & Erika's notes on the train after Birmingham.
(in which Erika succinctly refutes two hypotheses by txt message)

Q1: why is [Seek] easier than [Ask]?
Q2: What do children understand that enables them to succeed on [Seek] trials?

Consider three versions of the 'lightbulb' task (not suggesting we do these, just for illustration):

E.1 You push the button and Smoot says 'It's the turtle'
E.2 You push the button and Smoot says 'You put your button on the turtle'
E.3 You push the button and Smoot puts his button on the turtle.


Notes:

E.1 is closest to [Ask], the difference is just pressing a button instead of lifting a telephone.  

E.3 is closest to [Seek], the key difference is that the information isn't physically manifest before before the child acts.  (Sarah noted that the link between button pressing and talking is contrived, so button-pressing contrasts with looking around a barrier to see something.)

In all E.1-3 we have information that isn't physically manifest.

In E.3 the information ends up being in the same format as in [Seek].

In E.2-3 we have instructions, in E.1 we have a statement.

In E.1-2 you're getting the information from Smoot's head; it's communicative; in E.3 you just have to look at the result of the action. [rough; needs work]


Hypotheses:

Hyp. 1. [Seek] is easier than [Ask] because in [Seek] the information is physically manifest.  In that case E.1, E.2, E.3 should all be harder than [Seek] and about has hard as [Ask].  

Suppose Hyp. 1 is correct.  Why does the information being physically manifest help the children so much?  

Hyp 1a. (Liz' slide): having the information physically manifest saves the child from having to imagine E's internal mental state.  This fits the idea that children don't realise that asking questions is a way of finding out what people know.  

Hyp 1b. Sotaro Kita: possibly it's because the position of E's counter provides a reminder to the child that E knows; the counter is "charged with knowledge".  Kita also suggested having the child decide whether to ask E at the point when E is still looking into the box -- this would equally make it salient to the child that E knows what's in the box.  If this is right, perhaps the experiments show that making inferences involving knowledge is effortful rather than that children's understanding of knowledge is limited.

Hyp. 2. (credit Sarah) Children do realise that people will talk after they ask questions but don't realise that the talking will be relevant to their question -- the think all adults are like the distracted professor who no matter what question you ask always replies by talking about a topic at random (which is occasionally useful). So [Seek] is easier than [Ask] not because the answer is already there but because the form of the answer is tightly constrained (counter will be in one of three positions).  If that's right E.3 should be easier than E.1 and E.2. (See Erika's txt below for why this Hyp. 2 isn't likely: in [Ask] the experimenter's answer is always has the same form, naming the item, so for this hypothesis to be plausible we'd have to suppose that children don't notice the mundane nature of E's answers.) 

Hyp. 3: Instructions are easier than statement.  Then E.2, E.3 should be easier that E.1.  But why would children find seeking instructions easier than seeking information? Because with instructions you don't have to think about what to do with the result, whereas with a statement there's an issue about what to do with this.  ERIKA'S TXT: YES BUT IN [ASK] THE EXPERIMENTER JUST WHISPERS IT's THE CAT, SO THIS IS ALMOST AS GOOD AS AN INSTRUCTION. (YOU JUST DO AS SMOOT SAID HE DID).  So Hyp. 3 doesn't seem plausible.


Ian's criticism of Koenig & Harris type experiments: (1) they don't distinguish between a preference for asking or believing people who are knowledgeable vs. a preference for asking or beliving people who have been reliable. [Maybe they have addressed this.]  (2) they don't distinguish between a preference for asking people who are generally knowledgeable from a preference for asking people who are knowledgable on the particular issue at stake.  Children might take into account how knowledgeable an experimenter is in general but not how knowledgeable she is on the particular issue the child's question is about.  Crude illustration: child gives one point to each person for every fact she knows; child prefers to ask questions of person with most points.  To illustrate: in the Two Box Experiment, we test whether children are more likely to ask E. about what's in Box.1 when E. has looked in Box.2 than when E. has guessed what is in Box.2.  (This is related to Ian's suggestion in question time, there he suggested having two experimenters, E1 says 'I know about *this*' and E2 says 'I know about *that*' and we check who children prefer to ask about *this*.)  On this issue, Sarah later mentioned inference neglect (Sodian and Wimmer 19?8) -- two objects are placed in two boxes so if you have seen what's in one box you also know what is in the other box; an experimenter looks in to one box; children are asked if she knows what's in each box and they say she does know what's in one box but doesn't know what's in the other box.  This is relevant but consistent with the idea that children's decisions about who or whether to ask might be based on how knowledgeable someone is in general rather than how knowledgeable they are on the issue at stake.

Of course, if children do taking into account how much someone knows in general when asking questions (but not whether they have knowledge relevant to the particular question), we might expect them to do better on [Ask].

Ian (in questions): what do we predict would happen if there were two experimenters in [Ask], one knowledegable and one ignorant?  Would children still ask the two experimenters indifferently?  

Ian (after): Does it really make sense to suppose that children understand knowledge as a private mental state but not as something that can be transferred?

Steve's second thought: in written commentary suggested children might be able to solve [Seek] because E's looking makes child more uncertain or perhaps even more aware of her own ignorance, and this feeling of uncertainty drives her to do something without fully understanding why she's doing it.  But this couldn't be why [Seek] is easier than [Ask] because children also observe E looking into the box on [Ask].


From the questions:

Why is knowing how you know so hard?

What about children asking questions about what something is labelled?  Are we saying they would also indiscriminately ask these questions of younger siblings or their dog?

Are children too shy to look around the barrier?
