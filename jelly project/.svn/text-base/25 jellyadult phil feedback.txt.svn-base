Dear Steve,

Yes, have done it now. Works well! 

I sometimes forgot whether I was asked for the red or the blue cup, due
to the repetitiveness (and I clicked too fast so that the question did
not really sink in).

I don't know whether this could be a problem for the experiment.

Best wishes

Dear Steve,
Have been trying to run through the questions four times. First, I should let you know that after the first time got stuck in the middle (at some point, something like 6 or 7 trail, the last photo saying what really was under the cup didn't show up, and couldn't go further). Also from time to time needed to click more than once in order to move on.
One thing I noticed is that instinctively I would have prefer to ask as little as possible, but then, since the asking was just pressing a button, asked all the time (thinking that in when Liz looks under the other cup, this helps me at least to rule out one option).
Also, since you didn't give a full description of what's going on, was quite confused at the beginning. Wasn't sure that there is always something under each cup, and somehow interpreted Liz facial expression as saying that there was nothing there. The fact that the bits that are supposed to be under the cups are all on display was part of what made it confusing. In addition, wasn't expecting cases in which there is a discrepancy between the question I'm asked and what Liz looks for, so at least twice, during the first time made the mistake of choosing the object Liz indicated thinking, by mistake, that she looked under the cup I have been asked about. Later, also made mistakes due to lack of attention while being asked the question - finding myself looking at the photo in which Liz looks under a cup and realizing that I forgot to notice which cup I'm asked about.
Hope this somehow helps.
Best,
Hemdat

Hi Steve,

I've done this, but I don't think I'm a good test subject. I found doing
this very frustrating. There's no rational basis for asking Liz, when Liz
doesn't show you what's under the relevant cup, right? The results of what's
under one cup, relative to the pattern of objects between the cups, don't
seem to repeat for the other side. If that's right it's irrational to ask
Liz when she isn't showing you what's under the cup in question, but it's
very hard not to, all the same, particularly since the time constraint means
that you may be going too quickly to remember, until you are asked again at
the end of the relevant test, which cup you are supposed to be guessing.

That's probably completely inpenetrable!

Ha - I have an embarrassing admission. I started doing the test and got up to about version 6 or 7. At the start of a next new test I clicked across the instruction panel without properly reading whether I was supposed to be guessing the blue or the red cup. I couldn't go back to the instruction, so I ruined my go! Might it be worth having some indication within the photographs to remind whether we are supposed to be guessing the red or the blue cup (i.e. an arrow pointing to that cup?) Sorry to be such a muppet. I don't suppose I can have another go as I've already seen the first half dozen cases. Cheers, Dawn
