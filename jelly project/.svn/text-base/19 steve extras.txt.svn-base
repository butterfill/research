Beneficiaries
-------------
The main beneficiaries will be academics: psychologists with an interest in young children's social and cognitive development, and philosophers of mind.  We list philosophers as beneficiaries for several reasons.  First a philosophical question is central to our work (What is involved in understanding knowledge, and what stages or forms of understanding must be distinguished?)  Second there has been extensive debate in philosophy on theory of mind generally.  We aim to contribute to this debate by focussing on knowledge rather than belief and by examining children's strategies for acquiring knowledge whereas other research emphasises only how children use their knowledge.  Third there is an longstanding debate concerning the nature of inquiry (e.g. Dewey 1938; Stich 1990; Hookway 2000; Butterfill 2003 [D.Phil thesis]) which is guided almost entirely by reflection on adult competence; it is possible that facts about the strategies, heuristics and insights of children as novice inquirers should also inform this debate.
