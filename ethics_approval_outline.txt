Approval will be sought from the Humanities & Social Sciences Research Ethics Sub-committee (HSSREC), as is standard for this kind of research.

No ethical issues or sensitive topics will be covered during the course of the project. No children or vulnerable adults will be participants.

All data will be collected online, so the applicant will not be meeting respondents in person.

Informed consent will be obtained from all participants using an online consent form.

Confidentiality will be insured through the use of standard procedures.
