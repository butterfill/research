For definitions of automatic processing the authors cite Bargh 1994.  In this chapter, Bargh writes specifies ‘the defining qualities of automaticity’ as ’the extent to which thought and behavior are unintentional, occur outside of awareness, are uncontrollable, and are efficient in their use of attentional resources’.  He goes on to assert that ‘Ten years ago the consensus view was that a mental process was either automatic -- possessing all four of those qualities -- or controlled, possessing all the opposite qualities ... It has since become increasingly clear that mental processes at the level of complexity studies by social psychologists are not exclusively automatic or excluively controlled, but are in fact combinations of features of each’ (Bargh 1994, pp. 2-3).
