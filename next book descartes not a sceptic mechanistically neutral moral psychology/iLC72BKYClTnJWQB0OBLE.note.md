*This was supposed to be an idea for my next book or grant. I left this too long without developing it, so it’s currently in a bad state. Abandon?*


The overall idea was that if dual-process theories are correct, our ways of understanding the world rely too much on folk structures which we can abandon. (TODO: put that better!)

* start with the discussion of Descartes not being a sceptic but someone who wanted to challenge the role of intuition in characterising how things actually are (see \ref{project:yBJbvChdH4Dw3KBT3MQHp})

* naive physics and how it shapes experience

* minimal mindreading and folk psychology

* moral psychology

I have a paper note (`grant Descartes naive physics 2022_09_28 22_19 Office Lens.pdf`) that seemed more revealing that it really is.

## Motivation

This is maybe a way of connecting everything I’ve been doing:
  * moral psychology (\ref{project:c2151df6-d88e-4d30-930e-4cb99632641c} and \ref{project:ea14eb8d-284c-4da3-b488-f6e66da7825a})
  * mindreading
  * two systems (\ref{project:5861cde3-b3c0-4e29-879d-b43940c97694})
  * folk psychology (\ref{project:9e6fa5e3-10e6-4846-a79a-988799ffb92e})
  * object cognition, especially the problem about fast and slow interfacing via metacognitive feelings (\ref{project:4cb66656-f62f-49fa-af74-5a9f37e3599c})
  * Descartes (\ref{project:yBJbvChdH4Dw3KBT3MQHp})
  * am I missing anything?
