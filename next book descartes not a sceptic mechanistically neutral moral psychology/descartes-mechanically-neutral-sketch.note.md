*I found these notes about a year after I wrote them. Not sure exactly what they were supposed to be about.*


Nisbett and Wilson 1977 - Telling more than we can know \citep{nisbett:1977_telling}

## 0. Descartes’ target

Not scepticism (trivially solved) but rather to introduce a different approach.

Aristotelian: systematise appearances, which reveal physical structures.

Descartes: appearances can be explained as arising from physical structures; mathematics, not appearances, gets us to the physical structures (no role for observation at all afaik)






## 1. Mechanistically Neutral vs Mechanistically Committed

btw, it should be understood as a matter of degree (because reasons are causes, there is *some* commitment about which states cause intentional actions in saying that intentional actions are actions that happen because the agent has certain reasons for bringing an outcome about)

Denis and Wayne 


## 2. Sources for Philosophical Psychology’s mechanistic commitments

(pre-)scientific theory construction [e.g. Bach 1978 on effective representations; Jeannerod on motor representation]

scientific discoveries -> reflection on these to extract themes and structures -> [e.g. Wu on working memory, attention and intending]

social interaction -> reflection on these -> [e.g. Davidson, reasons are causes; perhaps Gilbert on joint commitment (she is explicit about this)]

social interaction -> how would it ideally work -> [e.g. Bratman on intention and agglommeration]

social cognition -> scientific discoveries ->

social cognition -> awareness of exercising social cognition ->
