‘My initial impression is that the following isms are the most useful: dispositionalism, functionalism, materialism.’ (p.~1)

--- But we could also consider the commitment-based approach you develop (atelic commitment to oneself)?

‘Normativity.’ (p.~1)

--- Here we need to distinguish two points.

--- (a) Dennett’s idea that people believe what they are supposed to believe (‘you figure out what beliefs that agent ought to have, given its place in the world and its purpose’)

--- (b) sometimes part of what we are doing, in attributing beliefs, is holding ourselves and others to standards: it’s aspirational

‘The beliefs of the belief attributor’ (p.~2)

--- We should be careful. The FP states are not necessarily actual states. Or, rather, the model(s) underpinning FP are not necessarily particularly accurate.

‘whether, according to FP, creatures without language can have beliefs.’ (p.~2)

--- can attribute beliefs?

‘Common ground’ (p.~2)

‘Establishing common ground (“grounding”) is closely related to the attribution of beliefs’ (p.~2)

--- Davidson: belief attribution is important essentially as a means for keeping track of cases where our beliefs differ

‘Belief compartmentalisation is an important ingredient in Stalnaker’s account of deductive reasoning.’ (p.~3)

--- There’s an OUP collection on the Fragmented Mind in progress. Seems like it will be quite a key issue.

--- Must distinguish: (a) actual mind; (b) FP model of the mind.
