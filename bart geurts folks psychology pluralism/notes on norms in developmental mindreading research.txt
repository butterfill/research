This is a review. It discusses how whether an action is intentional infleunces children’s moral evaulations. 

> ‘We argue that children’s reasoning about and evaluation of moral agents, like epistemic agents, is aimed at analyzing the situations under which moral actions occur to distinguish intentional from unintentional behaviors’ (p. 348).

Evidence for this is tricky. Some of the most convincing comes from older children:

> ‘in one study, 3-year-olds were equally likely to help an accidentally harmful adult (who accidentally tore someone’s artwork and so caused a negative outcome) and a neutral adult (who did not harm anything). In contrast, 3-year-olds in the same study were less likely to help someone who intended to harm but failed (the art would not tear) than they were to help the neutral individual, despite no harmful outcomes occurring in either case (Vaish, Carpenter, & Tomasello, 2010). In a related study, 3- and 4-year-olds sought to rectify punishments given to accidental transgressors, but not to intentional transgressors, by spontaneously sharing their own rewards (Chernyak & Sobel, 2016).’

Vaish et al, 2010: ‘In Study 2 (N = 36), 3‐year‐olds helped an actor who intended but failed to harm another adult less often than a neutral adult, but helped an accidentally harmful and a neutral adult equally often.’

Chernyak & Sobel, 2016 : puppet knocks over a tower; adult reduces puppet’s reward; child but not adult has information about whether puppet’s action was intentional; child more likely to give to puppet when the knocking over was accidental.

Koenig et al 2019 also mention some work with infants in the first year, these sources are included below.

See figure 1 for the setup. Participants responded by choosing one of two puppets. (The following items use much the same puppet-choice paradigm.)

> ‘8-month-olds preferred a puppet who tried to help a third party in its goal (and either succeeded or failed to help) over a puppet who tried to prevent the third party from achieving its goal (and either succeeded or failed to hinder), but did not distinguish puppets who had the same intentions to help or hinder but were associated with distinct outcomes for the recipient of helping and hindering. Five-month-olds, in contrast, did not consistently prefer any puppets’

Experiment 6 is an attempt to contrast intentional vs accidental case where one character comes to the defence of an injured party by coming between the injured party and an agressor.  Response: puppet choice.

A reply to a BBS article which provides a concise overview (pp. 32--3 of the pdf Tomasello 2020); their key idea is that ‘children may evaluate moral and epistemic commitments differently’

This one is at most weakly connected to norms, but it’s a nice study ...

4-8 year olds who encounter informants who knowinglyly misinform them (a) attribute less positive intentions to them (‘Children were asked whether they thought the informant was trying to help them [...] or not trying to help them’), and (b) reward them less.  No developmental change observed.

‘I simply ask how, exactly, the moral stance relates to the intentional stance’
(in a reply to a BBS article, pp. 38--9 of the pdf Tomasello 2020).  Rakoczy suggests that \citet{tomasello:2020_moral} appears to see these as parts of one thing. 

Rakoczy’s comment that ‘It will be crucial for future research to better understand how, exactly, group stances, the intentional stance, shared intentionality and the moral stance, relate to each other developmentally’ makes me think that there isn’t much research on this yet.  (Tomasello’s reply likewise: ‘Rakoczy notes a number of ways in which my account conflates – or at least fails to keep separate – children’s sense of an intentional stance, a group stance, a moral stance, and shared intentionality. He very articulately illustrates how even a single interaction may instantiate these different stances and capacities such that, over developmental time, they become more distinct aspects of human social psychological functioning.’ p. 49)
