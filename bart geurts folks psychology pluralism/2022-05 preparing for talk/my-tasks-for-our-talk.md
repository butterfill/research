Bart will talk about folk psychologies.

I will talk about detecting whether communicative interactions are intentional in chimps using Liebel et al chapter 8 in 2014 book (Liebal, Katja. Primate Communication: A Multimodel Approach. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2014.).

Also Townsend et al (Townsend, Simon W., Sonja E. Koski, Richard W. Byrne, Katie E. Slocombe, Balthasar Bickel, Markus Boeckle, Ines Braga Goncalves, et al. “Exorcising Grice’s Ghost: An Empirical Approach to Studying Intentional Communication in Animals.” Biological Reviews, August 1, 2016, n/a-n/a. https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.12289.)

Key point: there is a jump directly from ‘intention’ to the operationalization. What is being operationalized?

May be helpful to distinguish goals and intentions.

TODO: discuss this with Richard.

Other cases we considered: gaze following; recognizing anger

FBT in Chimps: Why call it *belief* attribution? Is it basically the same thing as ordinary people do when the talk about beliefs? (Use my own Heyes quote?)

 - remember that Call et al 1999 used comparison of human and chimp on same task to argue that two tasks operationalised the same capacity

Intention similarly.

Fiske about emotions?

Richard chapter on Intention of Bart volume. Middle part tries to justify operationalisation of intention. TODO: ask Richard for the cbapter!

\citep{graham:2018_bonobo,hobaiter:2014_meanings,hobaiter:2017_what}: on chimp communication

‘Of particular interest, given the relevance to language origins, is the question of what chimpanzees intend their gestures to mean’ [abstract] \citep{hobaiter:2014_meanings}

‘Ape gestures show at least first-order intentionality: they are produced with the purpose of changing the recipient’s behavior.’ \citep[p.~1596]{hobaiter:2014_meanings}

\citep{townsend:2016_exorcising}: operationalisation that avoids attributing mental state attribution 

\citep{vail:2013_referential}: intentional communication in fish

‘species capable of theory of mind understand that other individuals have thoughts and feelings that are different than their own (Kano et al., 2019). Such an animal would understand that their caregiver made a conscious decision to deceive them’ \citep{oldfield:2022_you}

See \citet[Table 1]{oldfield:2022_you} (`oldfield_2022_table1.jpg`): theory of mind corresponds to ‘Understanding not only that an individual’s own existence in threatened, but that the threat is the result of intentional malicious deception on the part of the caregiver.’

‘These signals thus qualify, following the criteria of Bates and colleagues3 and Pika27 as intentionally produced communicative gestures and are understood by receivers’ \citep[p.~4]{pika:2011_use}.

‘The grouper’s signalling has hallmarks of intentionality. We provide evidence that the grouper’s headstand signal exhibits three features used as key indicators of an intentional signal production: persistence until the goal is reached, elaboration of the communication if it does not initially achieve its goal, and means-ends disassociation by using two signals for the same goal’ \citep[p.~5]{vail:2013_referential}

## For operationalising false beliefs

First, we do not really know much about the structure of Theory of Mind, and
different researchers use different taxonomies 
\citep{happe:2017_structure,beaudoin:2020_systematic}.[^tom-construct-problem]
Second, while there is some evidence that 
a wide range of 
false belief tasks appear to test for a single underlying
competence (\citealp[p.~650]{flynn:2006_microgenetic}; \citealp{Wellman:2001lz}),
when we turn to theory of mind tasks more broadly we find that 
different theory of mind tasks appear to test for different things in the sense that
an exploratory factor analysis fails to find that they load on a single
factor \citep{warnell:2019_minimal}.[^why-problem]

[^tom-construct-problem]: See \citet[p.~15]{beaudoin:2020_systematic}:
    ‘The lack of theoretical structure and shared taxonomy in ToM definitions
    and its underlying composition impedes our ability to fully integrate ToM in a
    coherent and comprehensive framework linking it to various socio-cognitive
    abilities, a pervasive issue observed across the domain of social cognition.’ 

[^why-problem]: It is important to be clear about why this is a problem.
    It is not a problem that Theory of Mind may involve a variety of different 
    processes and models, so that no single factor will explain performance 
    across a sufficiently diverse set of tasks. 
    But if you want to say, independently of answering the question about models,
    that we have a solid operationalization of Theory of Mind, 
    then you need statistics to show that your operationalization has some kind
    of internal coherence. 
    And that is what appears to be missing.
