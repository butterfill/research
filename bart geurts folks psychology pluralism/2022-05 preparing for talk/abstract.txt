Since the 1980s, “folk psychology”, “theory of mind”, and “mind reading” have become buzzwords across a range of academic disciplines, including evolutionary pragmatics.  Unfortunately, use of these terms is associated with some bold assumptions linking practices, principles and capacities.  Although the assumptions are rarely considered explicitly, they tend to make discussions of the underlying phenomena inconclusive or even unproductive. In an attempt to improve this situation, we propose to start with the better-established empirical facts, consider how the assumptions might be relaxed, and thus prepare the ground for more sustainable theoretical and empirical research.

Since the 1980s, labels like “folk psychology”, “theory of mind”, and “mind reading” have become buzzwords across a range of academic disciplines, including evolutionary pragmatics. Unfortunately, these terms are poorly defined (if at all) and are being used in wildly different ways, and therefore discussions of the underlying phenomena tend to be unproductive and inconclusive. In an attempt to improve this situation, we propose to start with the better-established empirical facts, consider which kinds of phenomena might deserve one of the labels listed above, and thus prepare the ground for more sustainable theoretical and empirical research.

Folk Psychologies from the Outside

A distinctive style of human interaction is characterised by the use of broadly psychological terms, as in ‘He did it on purpose, but I don’t mind.’  This style---which we label ‘folk psychology’---plays two roles in academic research. Is not only an object of study in its own right but also a point of departure for much philosophical theorising about actions, minds, knowledge and even metaphysics.  Both roles face a diversity challenge: as we will briefly review, there is growing evidence that folk psychologies differ from one community to another.  Yet it remains unclear how deep the diversity runs.  How can we distinguish cases where different linguistic means serve a common end from cases where they serve distinct ends?  We propose that answering this question a deeper understanding of relations between folk psychology (i) as a style of interaction, (ii) as a systematic set of principles with various applications, and (iii) as a psychological ability.
