## Notes

CONCLUSION ‘there appears to be meaningful variation in the extent to which the mind is a topic for discourse or speculation, in ideas about how the mind operates and the origins of behavior, and in how mental states and processes are conceptualized. Also important, there are similarities; for example, even when ghosts or dead ancestors are postulated, they are often seen as internally motivated actors.’

What Varies? Of the four listed under heading ‘Types of Variation’ (‘(a) showing different levels of adherence to magic, (b) making different conceptual distinctions, (c) denying what is negative, and (d) ensconcing different values relative to the EA culture.’), most interesting is probably attraction to magic:

> attraction to magic is manifested in two ways ‘One is that human psychology is granted to entities to which the EASSM [= ‘European American social science model’] would not grant it. For example, in many African cultures, dead people continue to live with their living relatives in some form. They continue to experience the full spectrum of human psychology, like desires and emotions, and are still able to act on the world. The second form of expression is expanding human powers to include features that are not allowed in the EASSM of folk psychology. Examples are assuming people can see or hear in an extrasensory way.’

‘From the available data on the EASSM, the mind is considered to be the seat of mental processes and states, including intention and thereby action. It is equated with the self and is distinct from the body, while being identified with the brain. The mind is a mediator and a subjective processor: How one perceives events is more important than the events themselves. EAs believe that they can and should know minds, and they go so far as to base legal decisions on these estimations of others' intentions.’

‘Fajans (1985) described the Baining of Papua New Guinea as having no folk psychology, in that they rarely comment on reasons for actions, even their own’ [footnote: ‘The claim that they have none is probably too extreme, judging by Fajan's own descriptions.’]

‘For Samoans as well, according to Ochs (1988), minds are unknowable and thus not relevant. Because motives are not important, children in Samoa do not try to get out of trouble by saying, "I did not do it on purpose," as they do in EA culture; instead, they deny having done the deed at all.’

Paul (1995) claimed for the Himalayan Sherpas [...] "they do not, or will not, or cannot talk much in abstract or objective terms about motive or intention in ordinary life" (p. 21).’ 

‘The Bimin-Kuskusmin (Poole, 1985) and the Ommura (Mayer, 1982)-both of Papua New Guinea- and the Kaqchikel Maya (Warren, 1995) are other cultures that are said to view the mind as unknowable and unimportant. ’

‘intentions are of more and somewhat different import for EAs than for Japanese or Sherpas.’

‘Cultures that do not discuss mental states either do not overtly explain actions or overtly explain actions as emanating from something besides minds.’

### influencing mental states

‘In some cultures, one sees radically different ideas regarding how some mental states are caused or altered. Some of these stem from beliefs about specific acts. A case in point is the Maori method for expunging fear. The Maori rid themselves of fear by crawling between the legs of a high-born woman or chief (Smith, 1981). High-born Maori women are thought to carry special energies in their legs, which can remove fear from another person who passes through them (Smith, 1981). Such mechanisms are not supported in the EA view.’ 

‘the means by which the Baining remove awumbuk ("a lassitude that people feel after the departure of visitors"; Fajans, 1985, p. 380): tossing out a dish of water that was left out all night and thereby absorbed the awumbuk. Again, an action that an EA would see as completely unrelated to the internal state is seen as affecting it. Whereas for the Maori, an emotion can be removed by special powers; for the Baining, an emotion can be transmuted into what is (at least to EAs) an inanimate substance.’

### possible universals

‘A candidate example is reading intentions, which Meltzoff (1995) has demonstrated may well be present by 18 months of age.’

### other

‘The Suya of Brazil emphasize hearing: Whereas EAs say "I see," they say "I hear" to mean "I know" or "I understand" (Seeger, 1981). If a Suya knows or has learned something, even a weaving pattern, she or he says, "it is in my ear."’

# effects of actions or mental states

Murdock (1980) claimed that in 80% of cultures, illness (mental as well as physical) is seen as resulting from moral or social transgressions. Indeed, in some cultures, anyone who suffers from any sort of affliction might be seen as having done something wrong in the past (karma).
