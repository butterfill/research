and, interchangeably, ‘commonsense psychology’; now more commonly referred to as folk psychology. Although widely ignored,<sup id="fnref:unknown" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:unknown" class="footnote">1</a></sup> no comparably detailed work on folk psychology has yet appeared.</p> <p>Heider’s overall aim is to advance ‘[t]he scientific study of interpersonal relations’ or, as we say, social interactions <a class="cite" href="#heider:1958_psychology">(Heider, 1958, p. 3)</a>. He views naive psychology as having a central role in achieving this aim.</p> <p>Heider offers two ways of characterising naive psychology. On the first,</p> <blockquote> <p>‘the unformulated or half-formulated knowledge of interpersonal relations as it is expressed in our everyday language and experience […] will be referred to as common-sense or naive psychology’ <a class="cite" href="#heider:1958_psychology">(Heider, 1958, p. 4)</a></p> </blockquote> <p>Like subsequent authors (including <a class="cite" href="#clark:1987_folk">Clark (1987, p. 140)</a> and <a class="cite" href="#dennett:2014_intuition">Dennett (2014, pp. 73–74)</a>), Heider makes an analogy with naive physics:</p> <blockquote> <p>‘In the same way one talks about a naive physics which consists of the unformulated ways we take account of simple mechanical laws in our adapted actions, one can talk about a “naive psychology” which gives us the principles we use to build up our picture of the social environment and which guides our reactions to it.’ <a class="cite" href="#heider:1958_psychology">(Heider, 1958, p. 5)</a></p> </blockquote> <p>What is the role of naive psychology in advancing the scientific study of interpersonal relations? Heider thinks of naive psychology as ‘unsurpassed for the description of even the most subtle relationships’. But science requires systematicity, which naive psychology lacks. Heider’s project is therefore to provide:</p> <blockquote> <p>‘suggestions [drawing on both naive and scientific psychology] for the construction of a language that will allow us to represent, if not all, at least a great number of interpersonal relations, discriminated by conventional language in such a way that their place in a general system will become clearer.’ (p. 9)</p> </blockquote> <p>Heider characterises the same work as offering:</p> <blockquote> <p>‘a preliminary approach to an analysis of basic components of our naive ideas about other people and social situations.’ (p. 18)</p> </blockquote> <p>Heider is explicit that systematising naive psychology is one way of understanding interpersonal behaviour:</p> <blockquote> <p>‘our main purpose is to make explicit the system of concepts that underlies interpersonal behavior’ <a class="cite" href="#heider:1958_psychology">(Heider, 1958, p. 12)</a></p> </blockquote> <p>In what sense might a system of concepts ‘underlie’ interpersonal behaviour? As Heider specifies a ‘program for describing interpersonal relations’ (p.~14), we might be tempted to construe being <em>underlying</em> as merely a matter of <em>being sufficient to provide a systematic description of</em>. Heider does, however, endorse a stronger thesis:</p> <blockquote> <p>‘The general features of the causal network are thus in some way internalized and mastered. They form the content of the cognitive matrix that underlies our interpretations of other people’s behavior and our attempts to influence it.’ <a class="cite" href="#heider:1958_psychology">(Heider, 1958, pp. 297–8)</a></p> </blockquote> <p>We can therefore regard Heider as responsible for introducing and defending three theses:</p> <ol> <li> <p>‘there is a system hidden in our [ordinary, everyday] thinking about interpersonal relations, and […] this system can be uncovered’ (p.~14)</p> </li> <li> <p>Uncovering this system enables us to describe interpersonal relations in a systematic, scientific way.</p> </li> <li> <p>Humans’ capacities to interact with others depend, in part<sup id="fnref:nuance" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:nuance" class="footnote">2</a></sup>, on them having ‘internalized and mastered’ this system.</p> </li> </ol> <p>How should ‘hidden’ and ‘uncovered’ be understood? Maybe the thinking contains only the slightest glimmers which provide inspiration and uncovering is mainly construction, so that ethnography would be irrelevant to uncovering the system. In this case, there may be a large gap between naive psychology and the psychological bases of capacities for social interaction. Or maybe the uncovering should be understood as merely tidying up to reveal things that are already present but not easy to see. In this case, we could interpret Heider as committed to the claim that implicit knowledge of naive psychology just is a psychological basis of capacities for social interaction. We are pushed towards the second possibility by Heider’s stress throughout on ‘analyzing the data through which our beliefs are revealed’ (p.~60). To illustrate:</p> <blockquote> <p>‘to study the cognitions and actions directed toward the perceptions of another person, we have to explore our beliefs regarding the conditions and effects of perception. […] The common-sense assumptions about the conditions that make it possible for one person to recognize what another is perceiving are for the most part implicit. If people were asked about these conditions they probably would not be able to make a complete list of them. Nevertheless, these assumptions are a necessary part of interpersonal relations; if we probe the events of everyday behavior, they can be brought to the surface and formulated in more precise terms.’ <a class="cite" href="#heider:1958_psychology">(Heider, 1958, p. 60)</a></p> </blockquote> <p>Heider appears to view social interaction as made possible by the internalization and mastery of a system which can be characterised by re-formulating naive psychology. This is confirmed by a second characterisation of naive psychology:</p> <blockquote> <p>‘naive psychology, the pretheoretical and implicit system which underlies interpersonal relations.’ <a class="cite" href="#heider:1958_psychology">(Heider, 1958, p. 58)</a><sup id="fnref:stich-ravenscroft" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:stich-ravenscroft" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>Treating as equivalent the two ways of characterising naive psychology presupposes what we will call <em>Heider’s Thesis</em>:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Heider’s Thesis</em> [broad version] All capacities for social interaction depend on representing commonsense psychological principles and making inferences from them.</p> </blockquote> <p>In case this thesis seems too obvious to be even worth formulating, consider some views which contradict it or at least justify considering whether it is true:</p> <ol> <li> <p>There are no commonsense psychological principles (we take this view to be refuted by Heider’s work).</p> </li> <li> <p>More than one incommensurable system of principles can be uncovered in commonsense thinking about social interactions (compare <a class="cite" href="#stich:1994_whata">Stich &#38; Ravenscroft, 1994</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p>Commonsense psychological principles provide limited insight into social interactions (perhaps because their role is not only explanatory but also regulatory (<a class="cite" href="#mcgeer:2007_regulative">McGeer, 2007</a>; <a class="cite" href="#zawidzki:2013_mindshaping">Zawidzki, 2013</a>) or normative).</p> </li> <li> <p>Commonsense psychological principles vary more between cultures than do capacities for social interaction.</p> </li> <li> <p>Human share capacities for social interaction with other animals that do not represent commonsense psychological principles.</p> </li> <li> <p>Adults share capacities for social interaction with infants but infants do not represent commonsense psychological principles.</p> </li> </ol> <p>One response to the last two views would be to retreat to a narrower version of Heider’s Thesis:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Heider’s Thesis</em> [narrow version] Capacities for social interaction involving communication about psychological things depend on representing folk psychological principles and making inferences from them.</p> </blockquote> <p>As <a class="cite" href="#stich:1994_whata">Stich &#38; Ravenscroft (1994)</a> argue, even this weaker thesis is far from being obviously true.</p> <h2 id="x"> <a href="#x" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="x"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> x </h2> <p>The broad version of Heider’s Thesis is presupposed by a body of comparative and developmental research. You can use Heider’s Thesis to get from ‘individuals of this kind exhibit a certain capacity social interaction’ to ‘individuals of this kind represent the corresponding folk psychological principles’.</p> <p>Further, the thesis is confounded with the weaker view that certain social interactions depend on representing psychological principles though not necessarily <em>folk</em> principles. One aim of what follows is to separate these views.</p> <h2 id="our-questions-using-heiders-terms"> <a href="#our-questions-using-heiders-terms" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="our-questions-using-heiders-terms"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Our questions (using Heider’s terms) </h2> <p>Weaker to stronger challenges:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Does the unformulated or half-formulated knowledge of interpersonal relations as it is expressed in our everyday language involve a system of concepts that underlies <strong>all</strong> interpersonal behavior?</p> </li> <li> <p>Does the unformulated or half-formulated knowledge of interpersonal relations as it is expressed in our everyday language involve a system of concepts that underlies that interagential behaviour which involves communication about psychological things?
