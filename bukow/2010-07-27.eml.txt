Dear Steve,

actually I am concerned with episodic memory in companions and the two-level mirror-neuronsystem in humans, whereas level 1-system should exist in chimps and some birds too. I have some hypotheses about such a system according to Minimal Theories of Mind.

Especially, I am interested in what you think about "reasons" in animals. I would agree Susan Hurley in "Overintellectualizing the mind", where she talks about some practical normativity in animals. I would give several proofs, e.g. the segmentation in vocal production/perception parrots (attachment). I am working on this and think there may be two kinds of Minimal ToM (with respect to brain design), what do you think about the topic?

With respect to episodic memory, maybe this paper in the attachment is interesting. I try a different approach with OWL 2, where one can have domain-limited reasoning. I think, the most basic inferential operation will be "merging perceptual fields", e.g. integrating visual and auditive fields and noticing a difference between both fields. E.g., in the Stulp et al. 2009 experiment: one scrub-jay merges his visual and auditive fields, represents/rotates to the other scrub-jay's encountering, and notices the differences between relations regarding visible and audible properties of caches. This can be done purely in a hippocampus-like structure with fields and representations, and without propositions. It is just tracking by merging/integrating representations.
Viele Grüße
Gerhard
