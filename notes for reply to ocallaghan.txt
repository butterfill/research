Start with what we agree on ---

p. 32: "It is one thing to say speech perception bears information about intended articulatory gestures; it is another to say that intended articulatory gestures are among the apparent objects of perceptual experience, or that they figure as described in the phenomenal contents of perceptual experience"

@'s inference from this is that Liberman is wrong; my inference is that Liberman is not taling about phenomenal content.


Arg takes phenomenal patters of similarity and difference as a starting point.  Correct that I'm wrong if this premise is correct.

Two main points

(1) whether categorical perception is gradual in the way suggested (may be different ways of defining categorical perception and different phenomena)

(2) whether the phenomenal characters of perceptual experiences we enjoy when confronted with speech are part of CP of speech.

My arg. is not that patterns in judgements of similarity and difference do not exist; rather, it concerns how these relate to research on speech perception.  In my view, the phenomenal facts uncovered by introspection may not bear on the infant and word-blindness-etc cases, because these may be the due to deficits in speech perception rather than deficits in phenomenological character.

Seems to me that what is CP is gestures, whereas what is represented in the sort of perceptual expeirence that has phenomenal character is probably sounds.

Not obvious to me that the claim in the Matthen quote on p. 30 is correct prior to much learning -- that "phenomenologically ... when we hear /di/ or /du/ we seem to hear the same initial sounds--the consonant /d/--followed by a vowel."

p. 35: "you don’t need the concept of a phoneme to experience one"

p. 35: "What we really need, before continuing to argue over liberalism and conservatism about perceptual experience, is either a better account of the difference between perception and cognition or a story about why it matters."
