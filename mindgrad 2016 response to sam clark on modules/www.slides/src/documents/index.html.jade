    Encapsulation,
    domain specificity,
    limited access,
    and the rest
    are merely indicators of modularity.
  .notes: :t
    What matters is not the absolute degree of encapsulation (say), but rather
    that fact that differences in degree of encapsulation (say)  indicate 
    differences in the nature of the underlying processes and representational formats.
  .notes: :t
    This is because modularity is something that explains these properties rather
    than something that merely consists in them.

      As Sam writes in the paper,
      ‘Concerning how Fodorians should understand the natural kindness of modular input systems, my
      suggestion is just that modular systems might be distinguished in the human mind by an underlying
      type of computational process that governs their operations: i.e. that the essence of the modular
      kind might be a certain type of computational processing that is found in some, and only some,
      cognitive systems—the modular ones—and that entails and explains the manifestation of the
      superficial properties that these systems are seen to display to a striking degree.’

        A threat that Sam is aware of: opponents of modularity will retort that Sam has
        raised the bar for objections so high that nothing could show
        there are no modules!
      .notes: :t
        Sam’s retort (in the paper) is to emphasise that his view makes some predictions ...
      p.notes.show: :t
        ‘predictions ... whenever we find a module we will find that the content it processes is like
        that processed by other modules from the perspective of the systems and unlike that processed by
        non-modules’

  .notes: :t
    It’s a familiar idea that things---sounds, say---can be specified using
    different representational formats.
  .notes: :t
    Differences in format matter because they affect performance: some things that
    are difficult or impossible in one format (changing pitch, say) can be 
    possible and perhaps even easy in another representational format.

    .notes For example, in producing music (I suppose).
    .notes: :t
      This is the beginnings of an objection to something Sam writes:
      ‘critics of such a view seem required to hold the opposite: they must hold that the form and
      structure of the representations will remain constant across these systems, at least from the
      point of view of the systems doing the computing.’
  .slide
    +blur('img.bkg', '10px')
    p.center.notes.show.em-above Modules: one representational format or many?
    .notes: :t
      One the one hand, the claim that modularity has an essence suggests that 
      it has to be one thing, and in turn might be taken to imply that there must
      be one kind of rule-goverened computational process and one kind of
      representational format common to all modules.
    .notes: :t
      Sam himself appears to accept this view:
      ‘the essence of the modular kind might be a certain type of computational processing that is found
      in ... only ... the modular  ... and that entails and explains the
      manifestation of the superficial properties that these systems are seen to display to a striking
      degree.’
  .slide
    p.center vision -- navigation -- speech
    .notes: :t
      On the other hand, it seems quite plausible that different modules will involve 
      different representational formats.  Consider the modules that Sam mentions:
      vision, speech and navigation.
    .notes: :t
      Vision presumably deals with the arrangement of surfaces and objects in space,
      whereas navigation is about landmarks and speech concerns acoustic and bodily events.
    .notes: :t
      Can we imagine that these all involve a common representational format?
      Suppose they don’t, and suppose, further, that the underlying processes differ
      significantly in kind.
      This may well mean, of course, that these things---speech perception,
      vision and navigation---evince charcateristics  of modularity such as encapsulation 
      and limited accessibilities to varying degrees to which.
    .notes: :t
      Sam also writes that
      ‘critics must convincingly show that different modules manifest their distinctive properties in
      quite different ways such that these differences must be explained by the underlying properties or
      mechanisms of the systems themselves’

+slide_middle
  p.center Maybe there is no one such thing as modularity 
    span.hide.step2 ... but many?
  .slide
    +show('.step2')
    .notes: :t
      I think this is not strictly consistent with the view Sam endorses in the paper,
      but I do think it’s the view that his talk pushes us towards.
      And it may be true.
    .notes: :t
      After all, once we have the distinction between format and kind of process
      as a theoretical tool, why do we need there to be a single essence which all
      modules share?
