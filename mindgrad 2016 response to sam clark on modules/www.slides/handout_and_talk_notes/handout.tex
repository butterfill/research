What do we experience of action when we act together?

The \emph{Indirect Hypothesis}: experiences revelatory of action are all experiences of bodily
configurations, of joint displacements and of effects characteristic of particular actions.

The \emph{Direct Hypothesis}: some experiences revelatory of action are experiences of actions as
directed to particular outcomes.

‘word listening produces a phoneme specific activation of speech motor centres’ \citep{Fadiga:2002kl}



‘Phonemes that require in production a strong activation of tongue muscles, automatically produce, when heard, an activation of the listener's motor centres controlling tongue muscles.’ \citep{Fadiga:2002kl}


Motor representations concerning the goals of observed actions sometimes facilitate the identification of goals.

An \emph{experience revelatory of action} is on
which provides the subject of experience with reasons for thoughts about the
goals of actions someone, herself or another, is performing.

Motor representations concerning the goals of observed actions sometimes facilitate the identification of goals.

An outcome is a \emph{collective goal} of two or more actions involving multiple
agents if it is an outcome to which those actions are collectively directed \citep{butterfill:2016_minimal}.
