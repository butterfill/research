Maybe: Sam suggests one kind of modularity. But why not many? Since we donâ€™t know the process.
Also: object indexes vs motor system vs categorical perception. Surely here we have what might easily be quite a number of different kinds of process all of which have many of the features associated with module to some degree.  So should we currently be agnostic as between multimodularity and monomodularity hypotheses? (One natural kind or many?)
