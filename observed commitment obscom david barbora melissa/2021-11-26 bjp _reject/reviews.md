British Journal of Psychology

Dear Dr Michael

Thank you for submitting your manuscript to the British Journal of Psychology. The manuscript has been transferred with reviews from BJDP to BJP. In my decision, I therefore, considered the two previous reviews and I have additionally received comments from one new reviewer with expertise in the area. I furthermore read your paper carefully myself. The reviewers' comments are appended below.

All reviewers identify some strengths in the paper. However, they also raise some major concerns about its suitability for publication in BJP. Particularly one of the previous reviewers as well as the new reviewer share their substantial concern regarding the theoretical framing of the study and identify several issues that will be difficult to address in a convincing form. I share these concerns, and feel that these seriously undermine the value of the paper. Accordingly, I am afraid that I am unable to accept it for publication.

I know that this decision will be disappointing given the work that you have put into your paper. However, I hope that the reviewers' comments will be useful if you choose to submit the manuscript elsewhere.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for considering BJP as a possible outlet for your work, and hope that you will continue to do so in future. We welcome any feedback that you may have about the journal's review process.

Kind regards,

Moritz M. Daum, Ph.D.
Associate Editor

Reviewer #1: IIn the present study, the authors aimed to replicate and extend the previous findings by investigating the perceived degree of commitment that could be inferred from the level of coordination in joint action involving children. 
To this end, short video clips were displayed which were categorized into three groups according to the level of coordination, namely Low Coordination, High Coordination, and High Coordination with Ostensive Cues.  Participants were randomly placed in one of the three experimental conditions based on the video clips presented to them. After watching the videos, participants answered a series of questions that measured perceived coordination and commitment in the observed joint action. The highest ratings for the perceived level of commitment from participants were expected to be obtained in High Coordination with Ostensive Cues and High Coordination respectively when compared with Low Coordination condition.   
Moreover, the authors explored whether participants with a higher level of child care expertise would make a better estimation of the number of rounds to be completed by a child before switching to an alternative game. 

I have one major concerns:
1)	first and foremost, the manuscript largely lacks a theoretical framework. Too much space in the Introduction is allocated to discussing previous research, but the theoretical reasoning of the assumed relationship is rather vague. What are the theoretical processes involved? The paper leaves one rather wondering why this research is interesting and how it fits within a larger theoretical framework.

Minor points:
I don't see a reason for excluding a subject as an outlier given one data point in one self-report questionnaire as outlier. This seems to me a very questionable research practice. 

I do not see why explorative analyses are carried out if the study had two straight forward hypothesis. What do those analysis add and why are they necessary? Why have they not been pointed at in the introduction sections?
Also, the way the statistics are reported are difficult to follow. Any attempts to make it more comprehendible are appreciated.

Given these strong flaws in the theoretical reasoning, I can only reject this paper.



***** PREVIOUS REVIEWS - Transferred from BJDP *****

Reviewer #1: The authors of this manuscript present a study showing that when observers perceived adults and children interacting they understood higher levels of coordination as indicating higher levels of commitment to the ongoing interaction. I think that this is getting at an interesting and important dimension of human interaction, and our ability to be aware of the link between coordination and commitment to participating in ongoing interaction with others.

I only have two comments on the manuscript. The following two statements seemed to clash with the approach I understood was being taken.  In one sense these are minor quibbles I have with a couple of comments, that should not detract from an interesting paper on an important topic.  But in another way, the comments reveal a very different view of the nature of development and knowledge, as well as biology, and I point them out so that the authors can clarify what presuppositions or worldview they are basing their work on and justify their comments.

p. 3 The authors state that:
"This may be due to an evolved tendency to expect others' eye gaze direction to be a useful source of information, and eye contact to indicate another agent's ability and willingness to contribute to one's goals"

There is a considerable and important literature on eye gaze and of course we can talk about evolution, but to go from requesting that our wine glass be filled to an evolved tendency to understand "eye contact to indicate another agent's ability and willingness to contribute to one's goals" seems quite a leap. Clearly, they don't expect that eye gaze evolved as a way to get one's wine glass filled. We could think of lots of examples in which eye gaze does not indicate willingness to contribute to one's goals. Consider a teacher gazing at a young pupil glancing over at her neighbour's answers on an exam, or two people gazing into each other's eyes falling in love. Eye gaze could mean interest, surprise, preference. It could indicate yes or no, agreement or disagreement, or a threat and it could have many more meanings, all depending on the social routines in which it is set. So it cannot have a fixed evolved meaning, even if that was biologically possible.

What do the authors mean by "evolved"? Do they mean evolved as in humans tend to do this given a typical developmental system, just as humans tend to eat with their hands, because it is easier than eating with our feet (Bates)? Or evolved as in determined by genes?  In which case they should cite some source in biology showing that this is possible. If they can do that I would be very interested because I know of no such source.

Then when the authors discuss the lack of support for hypothesis two they state on p. 20 "this may suggest that the psychological processes involved in perceiving coordination and estimating commitment function at a relatively basic level and are not susceptible to learning."

What does this mean? That is, this functions at a basic level and so is not susceptible to learning? This sounds mysterious to me. It is hard for me to understand how this could work. Learning occurs in a worm with only 302 neurons. How is it possible for the link between coordination and commitment not to be learned? I hope that the authors can provide some links to the biological literature. I would be very interested. I may be lacking in knowledge in this area because all I have read about neural development is about how neural pathways are shaped through experience. Perhaps the authors could also consider the work of neural constructivists who argue that humans do not have enough genes to prespecify the incredible neural interconnectivity in human development.  
Another possibility is that the link between coordination and commitment to ongoing interaction is such a central part of human interaction that when people understand this as an aspect of human interaction they understand it when they see it happening with young people just as they understand it with adults.

Again, these may be minor quibbles, but they may reveal the authors conceptions of human development. These are not minor throwaway comments, they do entail commitment to extensive presuppositions, so they need to be justified.

Reviewer #2: What you write is clear and engages the reader. I think that there is a lot to be said for analyses of joint action and what we perceive in it. I also feel that the study that you have conducted is sensible and produces some interesting results. However, I am not sure about their contribution to developmental psychology or the theoretical and methodological depth of your findings.  I have some specific questions to raise in addition to a general concern about your paper's theoretical contribution.
The study is interesting although I'm not sure why you used adults as participants as you do not set the theoretical argument up in terms of how adults perceive adult-child interaction. I think that this is a missed opportunity.
I wonder whether you assessed the child's actions in the three different conditions. I trust that the camera angle in these included the three actors. You make no mention of the fact that the child was actively in view and that her [as depicted in Figure 1] reactions were visible to the participants. She might have responded differently in the three conditions (indeed I'd be surprised if she did not) and yet her movements and gestures were not considered. In addition you treat the three conditions as being different simply in terms of the two manipulations you made (coordination and gesture), but there might be other aspects of the event which drove the viewers' judgements of the nature of the interaction and its effects. So, in short, I'm not sure that you do enough simply by dividing the three conditions and assuming that you have manipulated only the adult's overall style and the child's attention to that. I agree with the limitation that you raise as a guide for future
research (You write "It is important to acknowledge, however, that participants in the conditions with greater coordination may have given higher estimates of commitment because the coordinated joint action appeared to be more fun for the children, or because the children appeared more comfortable with the experimenter when there was greater coordination." P 19). I feel that you should have done more to check the child's orientation to the adult.
I think that your hypothesis 1 ("The perception of coordination boosts perceived commitment.") is very vague. It does not make reference to coordination in terms of the adult or the child's perspective even though there are two questions in the method which refer to one and then the other. This then makes the interpretation of the results a bit general.
I think that what you have done in terms of the adults' assessments of the interactions is logical and sensible. I have one minor statistical concern. I'm not sure that you should use Mann-Whitney tests as post hoc comparisons between pairs of levels of an analysis without using a Bonferroni correction [and explaining hoe that was calculated].  The p values all show clear differences so this does not weaken your case (I suspect that someone has worked out an adjustment for the Mann Whitney as they have with other tests, but I have not seen one).
Minor points
The figures seemed to be copied and pasted from a statistics package output. I feel that they should be more presentable. For example, Figures 1-4 not start at 0.  
Page 2, para 2, line 7: Should you be following APA 7 and using et al for all references with more than 2 authors?  There is no comma after Michael. (See also Page 19, para 2, line 3)
Page 3, para 3, line  9: Take initials out of Friesen, C.K., Kingstone, A.,
