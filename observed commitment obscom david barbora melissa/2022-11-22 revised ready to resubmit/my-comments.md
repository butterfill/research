On p. 2  at the end of the Hypothesis 2 we have ‘.)’ which should be ‘).’

‘Performing a Shapiro-Wilk test determined our data to be non-normally distributed (p < .001). This warranted the adoption of nonparametric methods.’ is highlighted on p. 11. This repeats the same text at the start of the ‘Analyses’ subsection so I suppose that one or the other instance of it should be cut (probably the first given that some of the data is normally distributed?).

Figure 2. Grabbed my attention because it implies that ‘high coordination’ was a lower number. Earlier I got the opposite impression (‘(6 -point scale: ‘highly uncoordinated’, ‘moderately uncoordinated’, ‘slightly uncoordinated’, ‘slightly coordinated’ ‘moderately coordinated’ ‘highly coordinated’).’) Also, the text led me to think Low < High < High+Ostensive but the figure shows a different pattern. It’s possible that I’m missing something obvious, but I think there might be something wrong with the figure.
