Dear Dr. Michael,

Thank you for submitting your manuscript, "Observers use coordination as a cue to children's commitment in joint action," with Mr. David Dvorkin, Dr. Barbora Siposova, Dr. Klaus Kessler, Ms. Melissa Perring, and Prof. Stephen Butterfill for consideration for publication in Social Cognition. I solicited reviews from two experts. I also read the paper independently before consulting the reviews. Before turning to the decision about this manuscript, I would like to apologize for the delay in getting back to you about your submission. Due to various issues, I did not meet my goal of responding to authors within a month of receiving reviews. I hope the time delay has not produced too much of an inconvenience for you.

I approached this paper with great interest, seeing the value of understanding how third-party observers draw inferences about commitment based on behaviors indicating coordination. The research has clear implications for parent-child relations, research on social inference, and Human-Robotic Interaction, to name just a few potential audiences. However, as I read the manuscript, several concerns about the degree that this study provides clear answers to the questions posed. More broadly, it is not clear that this study adds extensively beyond what you reported in your literature review. It would be challenging to add substantially to the understanding of how and when inferences about commitment are drawn from observations of behavior in a single experiment. Therefore, although I hope you will continue this research and will consider Social Cognition in the future, I am sorry to report that this paper cannot be accepted for publication at this time.

I want to explain this decision in the hopes that they help you conduct future research. Each of these elements provided some ambiguity regarding the ability of this study to answer the interesting questions you raised. Moreover, the reviewers' comments should also be helpful as you continue your research.

Your literature review noted that your research was building on previous findings that i) adult participants who observe videos of two actors engaged in a joint action rate interactions with a higher degree of coordination as involving a higher degree of commitment, and ii) that ostensive eye contact promoted expectations of cooperation and commitment to cooperation for children. The current study then "aims to investigate whether adult-child joint actions with higher levels of coordination - with or without ostensive cues - are perceived as involving higher levels of commitment." Unfortunately, the aims of this study appear relatively incremental regarding the previous findings you report. It is unclear what exactly is new here (showing whether previous effects for observations of adults replicate for children?) and why that is important.

You do raise some new issues that might be relevant (e.g., "we should expect adult perceivers with a high degree of experience with children to be particularly sensitive to these cues...[and] more accurate in their estimates of children's commitment") but, as the reviewers note, this focus is not justified and discussed in any detail. Therefore, the scholarly contribution of this research is limited.

Some modifications to your study might be helpful in broadening the questions you are asking. For example, you report evidence from three conditions: no cooperation, cooperation, and cooperation with ostensive cues. These conditions appear to represent three cells from a 2 x 2 factorial design involving different levels of cooperation than the presence or absence of ostensive cues. What happens when there are ostensive cues but minimal cooperation? This might be a puzzling circumstance, but it would allow the role of ostensive cues alone in signaling commitment.

Moreover, I would encourage greater precision in manipulations of ostensive cues. Your literature review discusses gaze cues, but your study appears to include multiple cues, including "holding the ball up while waiting, engaging in ostensive eye contact, and saying the child's name directly before putting the balls into the lift and lifting them together." Ideally, one would manipulate these individually to determine which cues are critical in communicating cooperation and commitment.

I am sorry that I could not provide a more positive response to the manuscript. The focus of this research is interesting, and the potential of this work is high. I hope these comments will prove helpful as you continue your work and ask that you continue to consider Social Cognition as an outlet as it progresses.

Sincerely,

Steven Stroessner, Ph.D.
Associate Editor

## Reviewer #1 (Comments for the Author (Required)):

The authors report findings of an experiment testing whether third party observers associate higher levels of coordinated action between actors (a child and an adult) with higher levels of commitment to a joint action between those actors. Perception of commitment is measured with by asking participants to predict how long the joint action between the two parties will continue. The authors find that do associate higher levels of coordination with higher levels of commitment to the joint action between the adult and child, in line with similar findings with two adults interacting. The authors also predicted that experience with children would predict the ability to interpret cues of coordination and thus commitment, however they did not find this was the case. Overall, the manuscript is concise and well-written. I do have some suggestions to improve clarity of concepts and predictions as well as fully addressing some limitations of the study. Please see the detailed suggested
by section below.


Page 2: The authors state that "performance of her part within a highly coordinated joint action
signals her expectations about the other agent's upcoming actions". However, it is not clear what is meant by "highly coordinated". For example, does this refer to behavioural synchrony, joint efficiency of behaviour, communication between actors. Do the authors have expectations about how different aspects of coordination relate to expectations of commitment? It would also be helpful to be more specific about what is meant by the coordination measured in evidence drawn from the literature throughout the manuscript.

Page 3: The authors switch between discussing how coordination signals a commitment as a participant in the interaction, to the perception of commitment as a third-party observer. It may be helpful for the authors to make an explicit statement about whether they assume that the third-party perception of commitment is driven by the same experience they would have as a direct participant and to make clear that the experiment can only directly test whether third parties use coordination as cur for commitment. This is also relevant for the discussion section in which the authors suggest implications for perceptions of commitment both as direct participant and third party (page 17).

Page 5: The basis for the hypothesis that adults with more experience of children should be significantly better at perceiving is not made clear in the manuscript. It seems to imply that coordination cues are different in children from adults, and that adults would need some experience to be familiar with these differences. This is briefly mentioned in the discussion section (page 18), however, could the authors be more explicit about their reasoning for this part of the experiment.

Page 5: The video stimuli include 4 year old children interacting with adults. Is there a particular reason for choosing this age group? I understand that these are available from another study but I think it would still be important to discuss how the results may differ had you used videos with younger or older children.

Page 7: The sample of adults is very young and I think this should be more clearly addressed by the authors. This is particularly the case as one of their measures experience with children and this is likely to be limited in 20 year olds in comparison to a more representative sample with older adults. It would be helpful to report the distribution of responses to this measure in the results section (currently part of the distribution is reported in the discussion, page 18).


Figures:
There are no figure captions which makes it difficult to interpret the figures with certainty but it looks like the figures don't match the reported results. Perceived coordination and committment are highest in the low coordination condition (assuming that 1 on the scale means low commitment/coordination) and lowest in the high coordinatin condition.

I would also suggest the figures include the data points rather than just the filled box plots, this makes the distribution much easier to see.


## Reviewer #2 (Comments for the Author (Required)):

The current manuscript examines adults' perceptions of coordination and commitment between adult-child dyads that were manipulated via the adult's behavior to create coordination including ostensive cues (i.e. high coordination), coordination without ostensive cues (i.e. medium coordination), and low coordination. The results from adults' explicit responses indicate that they perceive greater coordination as intended, that they also expect greater commitment from children in the conditions with higher coordination. A second hypothesis that participants with more personal experience with children would have more accurate ratings was not supported. Overall, I find the current work to be interesting and have value for the field of social interaction perception. I do however have some comments and suggestions for improving the manuscript as I describe below.

1. Note that on p.8 "no-coordination" is used instead of "low-coordination".
2. Something is wrong with the statistics for coordination (page 13) and with Figure 2. Fig 2 shows conditions with medians of 5, 3, and 4. The description in text lists medians of 5, 3, and 3. It seems like the High Coordination descriptive statistics are wrong in the text and the labels on the figure should be Ostensive, Low, High, not Low, High, Ostensive, however this should be carefully checked.
3. p.14. The result only partially supports H1 because it was predicted that ostensive cues would further increase perception of commitment. (For example, in the pre-registration, the three conditions were presented as being ranked from high to medium to low coordination)
4. p.14. The test of correlation between commitment and coordination responses, since it's an average score per participant, could just be showing that some people use the scale differently than others. It would be better to do this analysis on a per-trial basis, using for example mixed effects linear regression with a random effect for participant. This would be able to show that for each interaction observed, commitment and coordination are related, rather than that participants with overall high (or low) commitment ratings also give overall high (or low) coordination ratings.
5. p.16-17. Another potential explanation for the difference across coordination and commitment judgments for ostensive cues is that the ostensive cues are from the adult only and the coordination condition is about both participants in a bi-directional relationship - thus, the adult's gaze timing affects the overall coordination of the dyad. In contrast, the commitment question is only about the child and the child's behavior may not actually differ across the two conditions - the child's behavioral indicators of commitment to the adult (unidirectional) are not directly affected by the adult's gaze patterns.
6. p. 18. Regarding H2, there is likely not enough variability within student population for experience with children and the subjective ratings are difficult to compare (one person's idea of "extensive" might be very different from another's). It would be better to include child care workers or parents to obtain more reliable variation.
7. p.18. I think it is an exaggeration to suggest that cues related to social coordination are canalized based on this line of argumentation. It seems quite possible that coordination cues are simply learned based on experience (experience-dependent development). Just because someone has little experience with children does not mean they have little experience with social interaction.
8. p.18-19 The later part of this same paragraph seems to also go off-track. Why is it that a lack of child-experience effect on judgments would imply that children give different coordination cues than adults? And why would that imply that teachers would be unable to judge a child's commitment to "learning tasks". The current study only looked at adults' judgments of adult-child social interactions. There was no comparison to adult-adult interactions and no judgments of child-learning task commitment. These conclusions and speculations need to be scaled back accordingly.
9. p.19 "impulses and constraints" is a bit awkward wording. I would suggest replacing with "insights"
