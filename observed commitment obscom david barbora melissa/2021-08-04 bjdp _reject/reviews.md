British Journal of Developmental Psychology


Dear Dr Michael

Thank you for submitting your manuscript to the British Journal of Developmental Psychology. I have now received comments from two reviewers with expertise in the area and also read your paper carefully myself. The reviewers' comments are appended below.

Both reviewers identify some strengths in the paper. However, the comments when considered together make clear that the paper is not squarely focused on developmental issues in a direct way (see especially reviewer 2). Because the reviews highlight general strengths of the paper it does seem worthy of publishing in a journal not exclusively focused on developmental psychology. An alternative to switching it to another journal would be to consider ways to strengthen the empirical work that would deal with the knids of issues raised in the discussion and also raised in Reviewer 2's feedback about development. This would be a new manuscript though for consideration for publication in BJDP, and in my opinion could follow upon publication of this piece. For these reasons, I am afraid that I am unable to accept this manuscript in its current form for publication in BJDP.

However, in my opinion, this work could interest the editors of our sister journals. By following the link below, you can transfer your paper to one of the other BPS journals, where the editors will consider its suitability for peer review. You will not need to resubmit your paper and will be contacted by the editors of the new journal if any further information is needed.

Reviewer #1: The authors of this manuscript present a study showing that when observers perceived adults and children interacting they understood higher levels of coordination as indicating higher levels of commitment to the ongoing interaction. I think that this is getting at an interesting and important dimension of human interaction, and our ability to be aware of the link between coordination and commitment to participating in ongoing interaction with others.

I only have two comments on the manuscript. The following two statements seemed to clash with the approach I understood was being taken.  In one sense these are minor quibbles I have with a couple of comments, that should not detract from an interesting paper on an important topic.  But in another way, the comments reveal a very different view of the nature of development and knowledge, as well as biology, and I point them out so that the authors can clarify what presuppositions or worldview they are basing their work on and justify their comments.

p. 3 The authors state that:
"This may be due to an evolved tendency to expect others' eye gaze direction to be a useful source of information, and eye contact to indicate another agent's ability and willingness to contribute to one's goals"

There is a considerable and important literature on eye gaze and of course we can talk about evolution, but to go from requesting that our wine glass be filled to an evolved tendency to understand "eye contact to indicate another agent's ability and willingness to contribute to one's goals" seems quite a leap. Clearly, they don't expect that eye gaze evolved as a way to get one's wine glass filled. We could think of lots of examples in which eye gaze does not indicate willingness to contribute to one's goals. Consider a teacher gazing at a young pupil glancing over at her neighbour's answers on an exam, or two people gazing into each other's eyes falling in love. Eye gaze could mean interest, surprise, preference. It could indicate yes or no, agreement or disagreement, or a threat and it could have many more meanings, all depending on the social routines in which it is set. So it cannot have a fixed evolved meaning, even if that was biologically possible.

What do the authors mean by "evolved"? Do they mean evolved as in humans tend to do this given a typical developmental system, just as humans tend to eat with their hands, because it is easier than eating with our feet (Bates)? Or evolved as in determined by genes?  In which case they should cite some source in biology showing that this is possible. If they can do that I would be very interested because I know of no such source.

Then when the authors discuss the lack of support for hypothesis two they state on p. 20 "this may suggest that the psychological processes involved in perceiving coordination and estimating commitment function at a relatively basic level and are not susceptible to learning."

What does this mean? That is, this functions at a basic level and so is not susceptible to learning? This sounds mysterious to me. It is hard for me to understand how this could work. Learning occurs in a worm with only 302 neurons. How is it possible for the link between coordination and commitment not to be learned? I hope that the authors can provide some links to the biological literature. I would be very interested. I may be lacking in knowledge in this area because all I have read about neural development is about how neural pathways are shaped through experience. Perhaps the authors could also consider the work of neural constructivists who argue that humans do not have enough genes to prespecify the incredible neural interconnectivity in human development.  
Another possibility is that the link between coordination and commitment to ongoing interaction is such a central part of human interaction that when people understand this as an aspect of human interaction they understand it when they see it happening with young people just as they understand it with adults.

Again, these may be minor quibbles, but they may reveal the authors conceptions of human development. These are not minor throwaway comments, they do entail commitment to extensive presuppositions, so they need to be justified.



Reviewer #2: What you write is clear and engages the reader. I think that there is a lot to be said for analyses of joint action and what we perceive in it. I also feel that the study that you have conducted is sensible and produces some interesting results. However, I am not sure about their contribution to developmental psychology or the theoretical and methodological depth of your findings.  I have some specific questions to raise in addition to a general concern about your paper's theoretical contribution.
The study is interesting although I'm not sure why you used adults as participants as you do not set the theoretical argument up in terms of how adults perceive adult-child interaction. I think that this is a missed opportunity.
I wonder whether you assessed the child's actions in the three different conditions. I trust that the camera angle in these included the three actors. You make no mention of the fact that the child was actively in view and that her [as depicted in Figure 1] reactions were visible to the participants. She might have responded differently in the three conditions (indeed I'd be surprised if she did not) and yet her movements and gestures were not considered. In addition you treat the three conditions as being different simply in terms of the two manipulations you made (coordination and gesture), but there might be other aspects of the event which drove the viewers' judgements of the nature of the interaction and its effects. So, in short, I'm not sure that you do enough simply by dividing the three conditions and assuming that you have manipulated only the adult's overall style and the child's attention to that. I agree with the limitation that you raise as a guide for future
research (You write "It is important to acknowledge, however, that participants in the conditions with greater coordination may have given higher estimates of commitment because the coordinated joint action appeared to be more fun for the children, or because the children appeared more comfortable with the experimenter when there was greater coordination." P 19). I feel that you should have done more to check the child's orientation to the adult.
I think that your hypothesis 1 ("The perception of coordination boosts perceived commitment.") is very vague. It does not make reference to coordination in terms of the adult or the child's perspective even though there are two questions in the method which refer to one and then the other. This then makes the interpretation of the results a bit general.
I think that what you have done in terms of the adults' assessments of the interactions is logical and sensible. I have one minor statistical concern. I'm not sure that you should use Mann-Whitney tests as post hoc comparisons between pairs of levels of an analysis without using a Bonferroni correction [and explaining hoe that was calculated].  The p values all show clear differences so this does not weaken your case (I suspect that someone has worked out an adjustment for the Mann Whitney as they have with other tests, but I have not seen one).
Minor points
The figures seemed to be copied and pasted from a statistics package output. I feel that they should be more presentable. For example, Figures 1-4 not start at 0.
