Dear Mr. Dvorkin,

Thank you for submitting “Observers use coordination as a cue to children’s commitment in joint action” to the Journal of Nonverbal Behavior. Regrettably, I have decided not to send the paper out for review. Your work was very carefully done, yet it’s not clear what kind of significance it has within the nonverbal behavior field, nor what the important theoretical contributions were. Some of your results were (to me) very predictable, but some were also ambiguous as you note, and I for one had trouble catching on to what the paper was about. The Abstract was particularly obscure to me, because I could not connect the concepts of coordination and commitment to real life activities or any pressing theoretical issues. As I read the paper, I caught on, but I was definitely not swept away and I feel the total contribution is just not adequate for publication in this journal. I am also curious (perhaps skeptical is the better term) about your use of the concept of ‘coordination,’
because it appears it is operationally defined entirely by what the experimenter(s) did and was not based on any actually observed coordination between the experimenter and the child. When I read that your paper was about coordination, I thought perhaps it was about interactional synchrony or some other kind of behavioral coordination, but it was not (unless I misunderstood your method).

Actually, I am personally quite interested in the question of people’s accuracy in understanding others’ behavioral intentions via discernment of their nonverbal cues (a very under-researched topic), so I perked up when you started talking about accuracy. However, accuracy did not play a central role.

I wish you the best in your research activities and I suggest that the present piece could be of interest in a developmental psychology journal, as I believe it is more on that theme than on the theme of nonverbal behavior in particular.

Sincerely,
Judith A. Hall, Associate Editor
