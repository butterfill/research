Thinking about a submitting a possible BBS commentary on \citet{deneys:2022_advancing}. Both Jason Low and John Michael suggested this.

## Instructions

100-500 is optimal, and we value succinctness.

every proposer states their position in the field and lists between 2-10 relevant publications, again succinctly.

## To Submit

### 1. Name of the target article for which you are submitting a commentary proposal.

> Advancing Theorizing about Fast-and-Slow Thinking


### 2. All authors, including any possible co-authors, listed at the top of your submission document.

> Jason Low, Stephen Butterfill and John Michael


### 3. What aspect of the target article or book you would anticipate commenting on. 


Our commentary concerns the evidential basis for De Neys’ proposed model.  Whereas the paper primarily draws on evidence concerning reasoning and moral psychology, other domains including mindreading are mentioned only in passing. Will a closer look at research on mindreading challenge the conclusions? 

\citet[p.~11]{deneys:2022_advancing} writes, ‘The fundamental problem I will raise is [...] there is no solid empirical ground for the exclusivity assumption.’ But a closer look at the domain of mindreading reveals abundant evidence. We will outline this evidence. We also highlight methodological and theoretical consequences of including more research on mindreading.

Methodologically, the evidence De Neys’ relies on nearly all arises from observing a single, direct, verbal response. In mindreading, by contrast, the norm is to compare multiple, indirect and nonverbal responses. These include anticipatory looking and verbal responses \citep{low:2014_quack}, response times and choices \citep{edwards:2017_reaction}, or postural sway and purposive action \citep{zani:_mindreading}. The lack of solid ground De Neys rightly identifies in the domain of reasoning may be due in part to the predominance of less sensitive measures.

One theoretical implication concerns De Neys proposal that uncertainty monitoring controls deliberation (figure 1). Ruffman gambling: distinct responses but not uncertainty revealed in gambling. John’s Muller-Lyer example: felt conflict even after deliberation complete. These examples are unlike ***

## Discussion with John 2022-09-16

### 1.

\citet{vierkant:2018_choice} argues that keeping deliberation on task cannot be a System 2 process but must be a System 1 process (on the grounds that otherwise we would have to accept doxastic voluntarism).  His view seems to imply that System 2 cannot operate independently of System 1.  In particular, System 1 processes may be important for starting and stopping System 2 processes that we might losely call ‘deliberation’ (when is it needed and when is it enough?). 

This suggests a new issue for us: whereas before we focussed on how System 2 might influence System 1, we also need ideas about the influence of System 1 on System 2.

### 2. Is De Neys’ rejection of the exclusivity assumption incompatible with the method of signature limits?

A signature limit of a process is a type of response that the process generates which is incorrect or suboptimal (hence ‘limit’) and which no other process under consideration would generate (hence ‘signature’).  Using the method of signature limits initially appears to conflict with De Neys’ argument against the ‘exclusivity feature’, on which fast and slow processes are ‘exclusively tied’ to particular responses. 

De Neys’ argues that because automatization is always possible, any conclusion arrived at by a slow process could, in principle at least, also be arrived at by a slow process. We agree. But there are some caveats:

  * Although possible in principle, evidence for the existence of a signature limit may indicates that response automatization did not occur in this case.  And in many cases we would not expect automatization: given that the gains that can be made from automatization on any one situation are probably orders of magnitude smaller than the costs of automatizing, we should expect automatization to be selective for responses that are likely to be frequently needed in future; and if automatization probably requires repetition, we should expect automatization to occur only for responses that have occurred frequently in the past. 

  * Distinguish any response can be produced by *a* fast process from any response can be produced by *this* fast process. De Neys’ view that any response can be automatized is consistent with Steve’s view that *some* fast processes are immutable.


### 3. Jason’s Example

\citet{Ruffman:2001ng} finds a conflict between the responses generated by fast and slow processes (anticipatory looking and explicit choices imply incompatible predictions). Despite this conflict, children’s betting indicates that they were highly confident about the explicit choice they made. So: there are conflicting responses but little sign of uncertainty.  This is similar to John’s Muller-Lyer case except that in Ruffman et al’s example the participants were probably unaware of the conflict.

Conclusion: conflicting responses, whether or not we are aware of them, do not necessarily increase uncertainty.

Why is this relevant? De Neys’ model (figure 1) suggests that conflicting ‘intuitive’ repsonses should generate uncertainty which would trigger deliberation: 

> ‘ System 1 will continuously calculate the strength difference between activated intuitions. This results in an uncertainty parameter U. The more similar in strength the competing intuitions are, the higher the resulting experienced uncertainty. Once the uncertainty reaches a critical threshold (represented by d in Figure 1.2), System 2 will be activated. However, in case one intuition clearly dominates the other in strength, the resulting uncertainty will be low and the deliberation threshold will not be reached. In that case, the reasoner will remain in System 1 mode and the dominant intuition can lead to an overt response without any further deliberation.’
> \citep[p.~29]{deneys:2022_advancing}


### 4. Can we identify a situation like the Muller-Lyer or Ruffman cases in the domain of moral psychology?

A committed consequentialist has two children, one savvy and the other profligate. By stipulation, in these particular circumstances it is beyond doubt that the action with the best consequences is to assign their entire inheritance to the savvy child, cutting off the profligate one. Despite being confident that this is also the morally correct action, they still experience a sense of moral conflict. Probably because concern with fairness is inescapable.


### 5. Ideas about Moral Psychology

We wanted to get beyond fast=deontological, slow=consequentialist.

New ideas:

  1. There may be a range of independent fast moral processes, just as Moral Foundations Theory claims. These can generate conflicting responses (e.g. consequences vs fairness vs purity). If so, we should not be looking for a single moral theory (or model) to characterise fast moral processes.

  1.  Most of the current evidence for or against a dual process theory in the moral domain uses single, direct and explicit measures. This will only work (be sufficiently sensitive) if fast processes have a relatively direct influence on explicit choices. But fast processes may not  directly influence choices: instead they may provide changes in emotional and effective states, which could be used by slow processes that rely on heuristics. The heuristic is part of the slow process, not the fast process. This motivates us to focus on introducing better indirect tests of dual process theories in the moral domain. So far the only indirect measures used that we know about are mouse tracking studies.



## Discussion with Jason 2022-09-15

Conclusion must be not only that evidence fails to support De Neys’ conclusion but that it invites us to think much harder about how fast and slow are distinguished (not intuitive vs deliberative). \citet[p.~6]{deneys:2022_advancing} writes that ‘dual process theories focus on the interaction between intuition and deliberation’; from the perspective of mindreading, this is false.  It is, after all, super intuitive to say that Maxi will look in the cupboard.

All responses are a consequence of both fast and slow processes (Jacoby). But fast and slow operate on different time scales, and therefore unfold differently. Dissociations between different measures is one way to disentangle the influences of fast and slow processes.

Consider anticipatory looking. Fast process gets your eyes to the correct place. But has limited influence on verbal response, which is really the business of the slow process. So it is not the correctness or incorrectness of the fast process that requires a slow process; it’s that there are some responses that call for a slow process.

Is this wasteful? Imagine one person working out an impetus model, the other a Newtonian model. You don’t want one to provide an answer to the other; it won’t help and it could distract. Better to keep them separate if you can. And although having both models will often produce the same results (so why bother using both?!), they make complementary speed--accuracy trade-offs so it can be valuable to have both. Also important developmentally to have multiple models, and culturally. (Link to animal cognition: L1 but not L2 in chimps from Tomasello?)

KEY IDEA FOR COMMENTARY: There’s just a lot of evidence that De Neys is not considering, which ought to be taken into account and which may change the picture.  (De Neys does mention mindreading but gives just one source.)

Conflict monitoring: does this really happen? 

  * Ruffman gambling: correct response in gesture but wrong in betting without any sense of conflict. Mark of genuinely distinct processes is that there can be conflict without uncertainty. (Incidentally, we suspect that increasing time pressure would not help here.)

  * John’s Muller-Lyer example (aware of conflict but not uncertain)

Comparable conflicts in the moral psychology case? Committed consequentialist violates fairness, not uncertain but might experience conflict. Conjectrue: that fariness module is still exhibiting its signature limit.

## My notes before our meeting

Possible title? **A Mindreading (or Developmental?) Perspective on Fast and Slow**

Start with De Neys’ model \citep[figure 1 on p. 27]{deneys:2022_advancing}. What seems right? Whether deliberation is needed, and whether it should stop, cannot always be determined by deliberating about this. Otherwise there would seem to be a regress. So we agree with De Neys that deliberation can be triggered and ended by non-deliberative processes. Going further, we speculate that the ‘uncertainty monitoring’ proposed to trigger and stop deliberation could be achieved by metacognitive processes monitoring fluency, which contribute to confidence \citep[pp.~228--9]{alter:2009_uniting}.

We also agree that automatization can mean that arriving at a conclusion can be experienced as intuitive even though arriving at the same conclusion earlier would have been experienced as deliberative and effortful. Indeed, there seems to be a role for habitual processes to play in enhancing deliberation \citep{keramati:2016_adaptive}.



## The Method of Signature Limits

In studying cognitive development, the method of signature limits has proved useful for testing conjectures about processes \citep{Carey:2001ue}. A signature limit of a process is a type of response that the process generates which is incorrect or suboptimal (hence ‘limit’) and which no other process under consideration would generate (hence ‘signature’). For example, some fast processes for tracking others’ mental states are thought to generate incorrect predictions about beliefs involving mistakes about numerical identity 
\citep{Low:2012_identity}. Seeing the same signature limit in adults as in infants (e.g. \citealp{edwards:2017_reaction}), we infer that the fast process is unchanged by development.

If the method of signature limits has been successful (not everyone would agree; \citealp{thompson:2014_signature,Scott:2010oh}), what follows for De Neys’ model?  The model is based rejection of the ‘exclusivity feature’, on which fast and slow processes are ‘exclusively tied’ to particular responses. We agree that automatization occurs and that, in principle, sufficient automatization could enable fast processes to generate any response whatsoever. In practice, however, automatization is rare enough that signature limits are detectable in physical and social cognition.

From a developmental perspective, then, there seems to be little motivation to reject the ‘exclusivity feature’. Why are things so different in the domains De Neys focuses on?  We consider three possibilities:

  1. Existing attempts to model fast processes are defective. For instance, we agree that it is probably a mistake to regard slow ethical processes as exclusively consequentialist \citep{kurzban:2012_hamilton}, but better motivated conjectures about how fast and slow ethical processes differ are being developed \citep{cushman:2013_action}.

  1. [this is now the main point] If the effects are not very strong, maybe more sensitive measures are needed. The studies De Neys cites mostly involve measuring a single response and varying the conditions under which it is produced. This was always a direct response, usually some kind of verbal answer following an opportunity to read a vignette.  Inspired by developmental studies which include adult subjects, dual process theorists may do better to measure multiple responses to a single scenario, such as anticipatory looking and verbal responses \citep{low:2014_quack}, response times and choices \citep{edwards:2017_reaction}, or postural sway and purposive action \citep{zani:_mindreading}. Greater measurement sensitivity could alternatively be gained through process dissociation. [add: Another technique that allows measuring indirect responses involves asking about one domain (spatial) where answers may be subject from another domain (perspective taking); further, it is possible to change the reasoning task while measuring the same response, as when contrasting level one with level two visual perspective taking \citep{surtees:2016_unintentionala} but see \citep{todd:2020_goaldependence}]
  
     i. on this: Suppose we did a vignette study and asked for verbal responses under time pressure. Would we predict that 3-year-olds would be good at FB-location and adults poor at FB-identity. It is possible? But not finding that pattern would hardly dent our confidence in the dual process theory.

  1. Dual process theories may be false of reasoning while true of some aspects of physical and social cognition.

  1. Even if exclusivity assumption is false, mindreading provides ways of testing dual process theories. For example, tying up the protagonist \citep{low:2020_visiblya}. Here we do not rely on the exclusivity assumption at all. (NB this is not directly evidence for dual process; we do this once we know the response is driven by fast processes to test, further, whether the fast process depends on motor cognition)


The possibility we have excluded is that De Neys is correct to model fast and slow processes as tightly integrated. In fact we propose that De Neys’ is best understood as not a dual process theory at all. In fact, De Neys stresses that his model is about the contrast between ‘intuitive’ and ‘deliberative’ rather than any more constrained notions of fast and slow processes. We suspect, De Neys’ ‘intuitive’ and ‘deliberative’ both involve a mix of fast and slow processes \citep{keramati:2016_adaptive}. So when \citet[p.~6]{deneys:2022_advancing} writes that ‘dual process theories focus on the interaction between intuition and deliberation’, we disagree.  



We follow early dual process theorists in thinking of almost all responses as influenced by both fast and slow processes, where context and other factors may determine the relative strength of influence \citep{jacoby:1991_process}.
