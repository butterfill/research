Thinking about a submitting a possible BBS commentary on \citet{deneys:2022_advancing}. Both Jason Low and John Michael suggested this.

## Discussion with Jason 2022-09-15

Our commentary concerns the evidential basis for De Neys’ proposed model.  Whereas the paper primarily draws on evidence concerning reasoning and moral psychology, it mentions other domains including mindreading only in passing. Can a closer look at research on mindreading challenge the conclusions? 

\citet[p.~11]{deneys:2022_advancing} writes, ‘The fundamental problem I will raise is [...] there is no solid empirical ground for the exclusivity assumption.’ But a closer look at the domain of mindreading reveals abundant evidence. We will outline this evidence and suggest reasons why things are so different in mindreading than in reasoning.

Conclusion must be not only that evidence fails to support De Neys’ conclusion but that it invites us to think much harder about how fast and slow are distinguished (not intuitive vs deliberative). \citet[p.~6]{deneys:2022_advancing} writes that ‘dual process theories focus on the interaction between intuition and deliberation’; from the perspective of mindreading, this is false.  It is, after all, super intuitive to say that Maxi will look in the cupboard.

All responses are a consequence of both fast and slow processes (Jacoby). But fast and slow operate on different time scales, and therefore unfold differently. Dissociations between different measures is one way to disentangle the influences of fast and slow processes.

Consider anticipatory looking. Fast process gets your eyes to the correct place. But has limited influence on verbal response, which is really the business of the slow process. So it is not the correctness or incorrectness of the fast process that requires a slow process; it’s that there are some responses that call for a slow process.

Is this wasteful? Imagine one person working out an impetus model, the other a Newtonian model. You don’t want one to provide an answer to the other; it won’t help and it could distract. Better to keep them separate if you can. And although having both models will often produce the same results (so why bother using both?!), they make complementary speed--accuracy trade-offs so it can be valuable to have both. Also important developmentally to have multiple models, and culturally. (Link to animal cognition: L1 but not L2 in chimps from Tomasello?)

KEY IDEA FOR COMMENTARY: There’s just a lot of evidence that De Neys is not considering, which ought to be taken into account and which may change the picture.  (De Neys does mention mindreading but gives just one source.)

Conflict monitoring: does this really happen? 

  * Ruffman gambling: correct response in gesture but wrong in betting without any sense of conflict. Mark of genuinely distinct processes is that there can be conflict without uncertainty. (Incidentally, we suspect that increasing time pressure would not help here.)

  * John’s Muller-Lyer example (aware of conflict but not uncertain)



## My notes before our meeting

Possible title? **A Mindreading (or Developmental?) Perspective on Fast and Slow**

Start with De Neys’ model \citep[figure 1 on p. 27]{deneys:2022_advancing}. What seems right? Whether deliberation is needed, and whether it should stop, cannot always be determined by deliberating about this. Otherwise there would seem to be a regress. So we agree with De Neys that deliberation can be triggered and ended by non-deliberative processes. Going further, we speculate that the ‘uncertainty monitoring’ proposed to trigger and stop deliberation could be achieved by metacognitive processes monitoring fluency, which contribute to confidence \citep[pp.~228--9]{alter:2009_uniting}.

We also agree that automatization can mean that arriving at a conclusion can be experienced as intuitive even though arriving at the same conclusion earlier would have been experienced as deliberative and effortful. Indeed, there seems to be a role for habitual processes to play in enhancing deliberation \citep{keramati:2016_adaptive}.



## The Method of Signature Limits

In studying cognitive development, the method of signature limits has proved useful for testing conjectures about processes \citep{Carey:2001ue}. A signature limit of a process is a type of response that the process generates which is incorrect or suboptimal (hence ‘limit’) and which no other process under consideration would generate (hence ‘signature’). For example, some fast processes for tracking others’ mental states are thought to generate incorrect predictions about beliefs involving mistakes about numerical identity 
\citep{Low:2012_identity}. Seeing the same signature limit in adults as in infants (e.g. \citealp{edwards:2017_reaction}), we infer that the fast process is unchanged by development.

If the method of signature limits has been successful (not everyone would agree; \citealp{thompson:2014_signature,Scott:2010oh}), what follows for De Neys’ model?  The model is based rejection of the ‘exclusivity feature’, on which fast and slow processes are ‘exclusively tied’ to particular responses. We agree that automatization occurs and that, in principle, sufficient automatization could enable fast processes to generate any response whatsoever. In practice, however, automatization is rare enough that signature limits are detectable in physical and social cognition.

From a developmental perspective, then, there seems to be little motivation to reject the ‘exclusivity feature’. Why are things so different in the domains De Neys focuses on?  We consider three possibilities:

  1. Existing attempts to model fast processes are defective. For instance, we agree that it is probably a mistake to regard slow ethical processes as exclusively consequentialist \citep{kurzban:2012_hamilton}, but better motivated conjectures about how fast and slow ethical processes differ are being developed \citep{cushman:2013_action}.

  1. [this is now the main point] If the effects are not very strong, maybe more sensitive measures are needed. The studies De Neys cites mostly involve measuring a single response and varying the conditions under which it is produced. This was always a direct response, usually some kind of verbal answer following an opportunity to read a vignette.  Inspired by developmental studies which include adult subjects, dual process theorists may do better to measure multiple responses to a single scenario, such as anticipatory looking and verbal responses \citep{low:2014_quack}, response times and choices \citep{edwards:2017_reaction}, or postural sway and purposive action \citep{zani:_mindreading}. Greater measurement sensitivity could alternatively be gained through process dissociation. [add: Another technique that allows measuring indirect responses involves asking about one domain (spatial) where answers may be subject from another domain (perspective taking); further, it is possible to change the reasoning task while measuring the same response, as when contrasting level one with level two visual perspective taking \citep{surtees:2016_unintentionala} but see \citep{todd:2020_goaldependence}]
  
     i. on this: Suppose we did a vignette study and asked for verbal responses under time pressure. Would we predict that 3-year-olds would be good at FB-location and adults poor at FB-identity. It is possible? But not finding that pattern would hardly dent our confidence in the dual process theory.

  1. Dual process theories may be false of reasoning while true of some aspects of physical and social cognition.

  1. Even if exclusivity assumption is false, mindreading provides ways of testing dual process theories. For example, tying up the protagonist \citep{low:2020_visiblya}. Here we do not rely on the exclusivity assumption at all. (NB this is not directly evidence for dual process; we do this once we know the response is driven by fast processes to test, further, whether the fast process depends on motor cognition)


The possibility we have excluded is that De Neys is correct to model fast and slow processes as tightly integrated. In fact we propose that De Neys’ is best understood as not a dual process theory at all. In fact, De Neys stresses that his model is about the contrast between ‘intuitive’ and ‘deliberative’ rather than any more constrained notions of fast and slow processes. We suspect, De Neys’ ‘intuitive’ and ‘deliberative’ both involve a mix of fast and slow processes \citep{keramati:2016_adaptive}. So when \citet[p.~6]{deneys:2022_advancing} writes that ‘dual process theories focus on the interaction between intuition and deliberation’, we disagree.  



We follow early dual process theorists in thinking of almost all responses as influenced by both fast and slow processes, where context and other factors may determine the relative strength of influence \citep{jacoby:1991_process}.
