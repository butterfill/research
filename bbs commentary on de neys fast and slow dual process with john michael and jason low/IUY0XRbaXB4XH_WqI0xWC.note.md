Thinking about a submitting a possible BBS commentary on \citet{deneys:2022_advancing}.


Start with De Neys’ model \citep[figure 1 on p. 27]{deneys:2022_advancing}. What seems right? Neither initiating deliberation, nor stopping it, can always rely on deliberation. Otherwise there would seem to be a regress. So we agree with De Neys on this. (And perhaps the proposed ‘uncertainty monitoring’ could be achieved by metacognitive processes monitoring fluency, which contribute to confidence \citet[pp.~228--9]{alter:2009_uniting}.)
