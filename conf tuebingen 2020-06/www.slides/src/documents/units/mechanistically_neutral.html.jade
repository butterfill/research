  p.hem-around.q1 1. Which things are actions (as opposed to mere happenings)?
  p.hem-around.q2 2. Which states or processes enable agents to act?
  .notes: :t
    Typical to answer first question by answering second quesiton. 
    We saw an example of this already ...

        Those things which are appropriately related to an intention, or to a belief-desire pair, 
        or to some other state of an agent, 
        are intentional actions.

      How can we develop mechanistically neutral characterisations of actions?
      Consider the problems ...

      Personally, I would tell a story about motor representation here.
      Discoveries about the human motor system show, exactly, that is built
      to solve these problems.

  p: :t
    Claim: The problems used to characterise goal-directedness 
    yield one theoretically valuable notion of action.
  p: :t
    Jusification: This mechanistically neutral characterisation
    fits with discoveries about motor proceses.

    Do you face the same line of objections to your proposal.
  .slide
    .o1
      p.em-above Objection 1: model vs construal
      p.indent: :t
        Response: seek mechanistically neutral characterisations;
        rely on science for construals.
  .slide
    +blur('.o1')
    .o2
      p.em-above Objection 2: red
      p.indent: :t
        Response: permit multiple answers; do not treat 
        everyday thinking as evidence.
