How to Two Systems

target: Philosophical Psychology

Critiques : \citet{strasser:2020_inbetween}, \citet{adolphs_conceptual_2010} ...

Generality of the Problem: theories of social cognition, core systems, modularity

Maybe the critiques are wrong and something like modularity is right.

But interesting, give that we cannot know this for sure, to consider
whether a more modest approach is coherent and useful.
(I.e. not assuming critiques are right; but maybe we donâ€™t need the baggage.)
