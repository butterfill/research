\section{One-sided vs. reciprocal coordination}
In one-sided coordination, an agent attempts to coordinate her actions with those of another.
In reciprocal coordination, for herself and some particular other agents, an agent attempts to make it the case that their actions are coordinated.

%When an agent is engaged in reciprocal coordination, she might attempt to make her own actions more predictable so that the other agent can better coordinate with her.

Is the key difference we are after that in reciprocal coordination the agent takes the target with which she is trying coordinate to be an agent?
No.

I've lost track of exactly what we want.  
I think it's related to the difference between: (i) there being a goal which we each individually attempt to bring about, taking into account predictions about the other's actions; and (ii) there being a goal which we attempt to achieve by each considering what we need to do in order to bring it about.
