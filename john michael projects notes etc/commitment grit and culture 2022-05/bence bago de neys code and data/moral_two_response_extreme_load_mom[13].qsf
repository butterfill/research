It will take 5 minutes to complete and it demands your full attention. You can only do this experiment once.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nIn this task we&#39;ll present you with a set of problems we are planning to use in future studies. Your task in the current study is pretty simple: you just need to read these problems. We want to know how long people need on average to read the material. In each problem you will be presented with two answer alternatives. You don&rsquo;t need to try to solve the problems or start thinking about them. Just read the problem and the answer alternatives and when you are finished reading you randomly click on one of the answers to advance to the next problem.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe only thing we ask of you is that you stay focused and read the problems in the way you typically would. Since we want to get an accurate reading time estimate please avoid whipping your nose, taking a phone call, sipping from your coffee, etc. before you finished reading.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nAt the end of the study we will present you with some easy verification questions to check whether you actually read the problems. This is simply to make sure that participants are complying with the instructions and actually read the problems (instead of clicking through them without paying attention). No worries, when you simply read the problems, you will have no trouble at all at answering the verification questions.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nYou will receive $0.11 for completing this experiment.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nPlease confirm below that you read these instructions carefully and then press the &quot;Next&quot; button.","DataExportTag":"Q43","QuestionID":"QID43","DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false},"NextChoiceId":2,"NextAnswerId":1}},{"SurveyID":"SV_2gWPnIq1xhTORut","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID36","SecondaryAttribute":"What is the highest level of education you have completed?","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"What is the highest level of education you have completed?","DataExportTag":"education","QuestionType":"MC","Selector":"SAVR","SubSelector":"TX","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"What is the highest level of education you have completed?","Choices":{"1":{"Display":"Less than High School"},"2":{"Display":"High School \/ GED"},"3":{"Display":"Bachelor's degree"},"4":{"Display":"Master's degree"},"5":{"Display":"Doctoral degree"}},"ChoiceOrder":[1,2,3,4,"5"],"Randomization":{"Type":"None"},"Validation":{"Settings":{"ForceResponse":"OFF","ForceResponseType":"ON","Type":"None"}},"Language":[],"QuestionID":"QID36","DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false},"NextChoiceId":6,"NextAnswerId":1}},{"SurveyID":"SV_2gWPnIq1xhTORut","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID37","SecondaryAttribute":"What is your gender?","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"What is your gender?","DataExportTag":"gender","QuestionType":"MC","Selector":"SAVR","SubSelector":"TX","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"What is your gender?","Choices":{"1":{"Display":"Male"},"2":{"Display":"Female"}},"ChoiceOrder":["1","2"],"Randomization":{"Type":"None"},"Validation":{"Settings":{"ForceResponse":"OFF","ForceResponseType":"ON","Type":"None"}},"Language":[],"QuestionID":"QID37","DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false},"NextChoiceId":3,"NextAnswerId":1}},{"SurveyID":"SV_2gWPnIq1xhTORut","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID35","SecondaryAttribute":"What year were you born?","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"What year were you born?","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"year","QuestionID":"QID35","QuestionType":"TE","Selector":"SL","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText","InputWidth":60},"QuestionDescription":"What year were you born?","Randomization":{"Type":"None"},"Validation":{"Settings":{"ForceResponse":"OFF","ForceResponseType":"ON","Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false},"NextChoiceId":1,"NextAnswerId":1}},{"SurveyID":"SV_2gWPnIq1xhTORut","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID8","SecondaryAttribute":"You are a late-night metro controller in a station.
