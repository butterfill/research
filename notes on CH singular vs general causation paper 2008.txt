Minor objection: conclusion seems to establish at most that causal conecpts require concepts of the kind described by singularist theories.  That is, general causation is not conceptually prior to singularlist causation.  As far as I can see, it doesn't follow from anything claimed in the paper that you could have singular without general causal concepts and so the claim that singular is conceptually prior to general causation is not established.  (Actually a question along the lines of "What is involved in having causal concepts?" seems to me much more interesting and much more in line with the paper's argument than the conceptual priority question.)
