Note to self (and mention to David if he comes back): This is not quite correct.  See:
 
Bruno, Nicola, and Volker H. Franz. “When Is Grasping Affected by the Müller-Lyer Illusion?: A Quantitative Review.” Neuropsychologia, Perception and Action, 47, no. 6 (2009): 1421–33. doi:10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2008.10.031.

They argue that Glover & Dixon's model is incorrect, at least for grasping (pointing is a different story), because it predicts that the presence or absence of visual information during grasping shouldn't matter. But it does.

Hi David,

It was terrific to meet you in Magdeburg, many thanks for spending so much time in discussion!  I promised to send you a couple of papers about the effects of visual illusion on action --- the idea is that some visual illusions affect planning prior to initiating action but not the ongoing control of action; this explains apparently conflicting earlier findings.  These are the  Glover / Glover & Dickinson papers.

The view appears to be supported by the Bruno & Franz metastudy of action and visual measures in the Mueller-Lyre illusion.

I'm not sure exactly why we were talking about this on Saturday night but I think it might have been in connection with the question, How does information about others' mental states influence action in your helping paradigms?  I thought maybe the distinction here might provide inspiration, although it surely won't fit exactly.

best wishes,
Steve
