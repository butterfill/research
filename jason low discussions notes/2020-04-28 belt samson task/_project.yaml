about:
  This was a project to look at the effect of visibly constraining avatars
  in the Samson dot visual perspective taking task. Would the visible constraints
  (originally a belt, later boxing gloves) eliminate the altercentric interference
  effects?

  It accidentally turned into a different project about breaking the fourth wall.
