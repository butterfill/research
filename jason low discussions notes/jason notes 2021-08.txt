# agent specific

Jason believes its A
Steve believes its B

PREDICT : Jason will lift finger A
PREDICT : Steve will lift finger B



# agent neutral

its A [stronger??]
its B

PREDICT : equal between finger A & finger B

or : Prediction is influenced by which representation is stronger (e.g. seen myself vs observed Jason see)

Should not have different predictions for different agents


# self-blind (but not other-blind)

Jason believes its A
It’s B

1. If the efficient system is blind to the self [but not blind to the other], then I would copy you even if you have a false belief. [Steve doubtful]

1’. If the efficient system is blind to the self AND to reality [but not blind to the other], then I would copy you even if you have a false belief. [Steve doubtful]


# BRASS TASK

FACT: Jason has TB / Jason has FB

Instructions require lifting finger A but Jason lifts finger B (correctly in FB, incorrectly in TB)

Prediction: autotmatic interference effect stronger when Jason has FB than when Jason has TB

Hypothesis 1 : Neither self nor other specified in automatic mindreading (all representations are subject-neutral)

Prediction : when Jason does not act, P-A+ is faster than P-A- 

When Jason acts, because I don’t have a subject-specific representation I cannot make a prediction for his action based on his false belief. (I make the same predictions about everyone. No action incongruence expected.)  I will never anticipate that we will perform different (or incongruent) actions.

Prediction: ???

Hypothesis 2: Either self or other (or both) specified in automatic mindreading (not all representations are subject-neutral)

When Jason has a FB and Jason acts, I may predict that he will perform one action (incorrect action) whereas I would prepare and perform a different action myself. It’s possible that I anticipate that we perform different (and even incongruent) actions.

Prediction: When observing incongruent action (Condition 1), the Brass-effect is smaller in FB than TB. Why? Because the incongruent action in FB can be anticipated, but cannot be anticipated in TB.

We cannot generate this prediction from Hypothesis 1.



Condition 1: Jason performs an incorrect action.

Condition 2: Jason performs no action.

Condition 3: Jason performs a correct action.

Hyp 2: In Condition 3, if Jason has TB his action is expected. But if Jason has FB, his action is unexpected: this means I was expecting incongruent actions but I got congruent actions.

Prediction: if hyp 2, in condition 3 FB it may be that we get a reversed Brass effect.





Further Idea: Suppose we had a manipulation which we thought could increase the probability of subject-specific representations ocurring. Such a manipulation should reduce the Kovacs P-A+<P-A- effect. Why? Because more subject-specific should mean less interference.
