Jason’s conjecture: concerning the looking density, perhaps in the metalizing (=Belief) group, we see an effect of motor information (only) in the first half of the time period, and an effect of belief information (plus motor information) in the second half of the time period.

Steve’s suggestion: when participants are split according to the method they report using to perform the task (Belief/Other), we find that: (i) the Belief participants perform better than the Other participants on the FB conditions, for both DLTS and explicit responses; and (ii) the Belief participants’ performance is around chance  for both DLTS and explicit responses.  This is important because:

* it tells us that we have not merely confused participants;
* a false belief task on which adults perform below chance in quite rare;
* this is a (potentially entirely) nonverbal false belief task where the response is nonverbal and which yet does not appear to tap into automatic belief-tracking responses (the Belief group are *spontaneously* tracking belief, the Other group are not tracking belief at all).



# OLDER

# Background Observations

*These are already in Pieter’s notes, just here to highlight.*

1. Broadly speaking, DLTS appears to reflect motor information (and not to reflect belief information) in both baseline and mind-tied groups

2. Tying the mind appears to affect DLTS in FB but not TB conditions.
Why?  Perhaps because FB conditions are already more cognitively demanding, so that
tying the mind pushes participants over the threshold for being able to track 
actions?

3. In explicit responses for whole hand, participants’ responses appear to be more dominated by motor information in mind-tied condition than in the mind-free condition.


# Possibility 1 

Tying the mind reduces the ability to use motor information to predict action.
This results in DLTS scores which are closer to chance overall.  

Why does tying the mind affect the ability to use motor information to predict action for precision grips but not whole-hand grasps? We have no explanation at present.

Why does tying the mind affect the ability to use motor information to predict action in false belief but not true belief conditions?  See Background Observation 2.

Objection: Possibility 1 is incompatible with Background Observation 3.  After all, if tying the mind reduced the ability to use motor information to predict action, we would expect explicit responses to be less, not more, dominated by motor information.  It seems we must therefore reject Possibility 1.


# Possibility 2

Start from the fact that tying the mind affects DLTS for precision but not whole-hand grip. Why? Consider a two-part answer: 

1. tying the mind has a smaller effect on motor processes than on other processes; and

2. motor processes alone enable using whole hand grip to track action, but precision grip depends on more cognitive processes.  (This may be linked to the fact that infants acquire the ability to perform, and to comprehend, whole-hand grips before they comprehend precision grips (Ambrosini et al, 2013).)

If this is correct, tying the mind makes it harder to track actions using precision grips, therefore affecting DLTS, as we observed.  But how would this affect explicit responses?

Suppose, further, that tying the mind makes it harder to track false beliefs in giving an explicit response. Then:

1. for the whole-hand grasp, tying the mind interferes with mindreading, but does not interfere with using grip information; this results in participants further ignoring the information about false belief and so being more likely to give true-belief-like responses in all conditions, hence the lower accuracy in the mind-tied whole-hand false belief condition.

2. for the precision grip, tying the mind interferes both with mindreading and also with the more cognitive processes needed to make use of the (precision) grip information; these two effects result in more chance-like performance, which is why there is no difference between the mind-tied and the baseline conditions for the false-belief precision-grip trials.
