*Del Sette, Paola, Markus Bindemann, and Heather J Ferguson. “Visual Perspective-Taking in Complex Natural Scenes.” Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology 75, no. 8: 1541–51. https://doi.org/10.1177/17470218211054474.*

They put the usual red dots over photographs and did not found an effect when self-only judgements are used (‘no difference in accuracy or reaction times when consistent and inconsistent trials were tested for the self-perspective in isolation, suggesting that participants did not automatically compute the altercentric perspective when the other person’s perspective was task-irrelevant’ --- useful for us in emphasizing the virtue of our ‘meta-analytic strategy’ --- they speculate that the absence of effect is because ‘the complex natural scenes used in the current experiment increased the cognitive demands of the task and prevented spontaneous perspective-taking, perhaps by disrupting domain-general processes, including those that mediate automatic attentional orienting, and that this prevented or delayed attention capture of the person’s face and subsequent perspective-taking.’) but did find an effect when including other judgements.


# \citet{simpson:2017_intergroup} 

‘In three experiments examining two distinct bases for group membership, participants displayed more egocentric intru- sion with ingroup avatars than with outgroup avatars.  … however, we did not find any significant effects of avatar group membership on altercentric intrusion, and PDP analyses further revealed that automatic processing of the avatar’s perspective was comparable for ingroup and outgroup avatars.’ \citep[pp.~378--9]{simpson:2017_intergroup} 


# \citet{ye:2021_taking}

using other perspective taking tasks (director task and mental rotation) implemented in VR, stronger effects are found:

* for more human-looking avatar than a ‘robot’ (E1), and 
* for an in-group member (minimal groups; E2--3) than an out-group member; and
* for a naturally moving agent than for a statue (E4)
