Fleabag: ‘His Beautiful Neck' scene (youtube AAjwL-Bnfng)

total length: 01:09

24 frames per sec

I marked the start and end of each time Fleabag engages the audience.

The start is as close to Fleabag’s eye’s opening as I could get. 
In some cases there is a clear turn to the audience before the eyes open,
in which case I used that to mark the start.

The end is where Fleabag’s eyes closes, which is usually as she starts to turn away.

The durations vary between 7 frames (~290ms) and 30 frames (1250ms)
