  <div class="notes">I have a series of questions which I want to put to Wolfgang Prinz and
Michael Graziano.
  </div>
  <div class="notes">The broad thrust of my questions might be put like
this.  
Both theories involve taking as primary a third-person perspective of 
subjectivity or awareness, a perspective of it as seen by an onlooker with a
side on view.  
More than this, they aim to show that other perspectives, and in particualar
a first person perspective, are dispensable in the sense that we can
construct these from a third-person perspective.
Thus Wolfgang talks about importing from a third-person perspective on
another’s experiences and actions, and Michael explains awareness in terms
of a model of attention which describes attention as a relation
between a subject and a thing.
My aim in what follows is to explore reasons for thinking that 
other perspectives,
the first-person perspective and the perspective we adopt
when we do things together,
are indispensable.
It is not that I think another perspective has primacy.
My guess is that none are primary and that all are indispensable in the 
sense that you cannot construct any one from the others.

          <div class="notes">Common coding doesn't just mean that I can represent your actions

It also means that I can represent things we do together in the ordinary
way that I can represent actions.
Suppose we move a table together.
Given common coding, I can represent our actions in the same
way as I would represent your actions or my actions if either of us
were doing this alone.  Actions are represented in terms of events.

common coding suggests it is coherent to suppose that 
Animals could act together before they can recognise any individual 
agents at all.

together without necessarily recognising any individual agents.

His view is that there is a model of attention which allows me 
to make decisions about whether I, or anyone else, is aware of something:

            <p>(1) ‘my brain [...] constructs a set of information, A, that allows me to

          <div class="notes">It's important for what follows that this model is used both in
making decisions about oneself and about what others are aware of.

consequence of some extraneous factor.

So they attach the property of awareness to different object files
than adults do.
In particular, if you blindfold a 2-year-old at the start of a hiding game,
then take the blindfold off before actually hiding the object,
the 2-year-old will not attach the property of awareness to the object 
that is hidden and so will not be aware of this object.

It is not a theoretical claim but a feature of commonsense thinking

Graziano and Prinz can deny that this is a fact, but their theories

So let me ask another question,
How can either theory explain the intuition?

On Michael's view, awareness is modelled as a relation between a subject, S,

So it's clear that I would think of awareness as putting me in touch
with X, and so being able to think about it.
Likewise, on Prinz’ view, I come to think of myself as having mental states
by first ascribing them to others, and in ascribing them to others I am
relating others to objects.
So again the ‘intuition of mental access’ can be explained even if 
the intuition is, strictly speaking, wrong.

Let’s stop taking one perspective or aspect of subjective experience 
to be primary and trying to construct others. 
I suspect that the first-person perspective, phenomenal aspects of 
expeirence and the social are all indispensable.
What I have learned is not that something is primary, but rather
that things typically thought about as narrowly first-person phenomena are
actually intrinscially bound up with the social.
It's not about deciding what is primary and what is constructed;
it's about tracing the ways in which different perspectives are interdependent.

Suppose you attend to the shape and let’s say you’ve seen lots of these
so you’re really focussed on the shape.
You might say, sincerely, ‘I was aware of the shape but not the colour.’
Even so, you are computing its categorical colour properties, as is 
shown by the fact that you can get odd-ball effects for changes in 
categorical colour properties.
So X includes inforamation about shape plus information about categorical 
colour.
But on the additive model, A gets added to X or not.
Given the additive nature of the model,
how can we distinguish this case, in which there is awareness shape 
from a case in which you are aware of categorical colour and shape?
Is the idea, for example, that the awareness feature gets bound to 
something other than an object, perhaps a partial object?

          <div class="notes">It is striking that children’s understanding of awareness appears to 
develop quite gradually over the first years of life.
For example, some findings indicate that two-year-olds treat
people as unanware of things if they have been bindfolded at some point
during a hiding episode, even if their eyes were open at the crucial 
moment (Dunham et al (2000)).

          <div class="notes">Reluctant to infer from judgements direct to the model, but plausible 
that there are changes.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">Consequence of Graziano's theory is that these changes should be reflected
in the nature of children’s awareness.

          <div class="notes">Experience involves a subject, S, being aware, A, of a thing, X.
Roughly speaking, 
Prinz focusses on the subject of experience, S,
and Graziano about the awareness, A, the thing in the middle.
(Graziano says his theory is about the thing that ‘lies between the “I” and 
the “X,”’ (p. 30)).
I want to start with two questions about the X, the first for Graziano
and the second for Prinz.
