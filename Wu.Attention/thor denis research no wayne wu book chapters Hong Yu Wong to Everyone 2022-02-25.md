Lovely to see you Steve!!!!!!
Hong Yu Wong to Everyone (16:31)
Why are these reflexes in the neurological sense?
Me to Hong Yu Wong (Direct Message) (16:32)
likewise
Hong Yu Wong to Me (Direct Message) (16:32)
You’re looking very pensive
Me to Hong Yu Wong (Direct Message) (16:32)
I saw yesterday in my diary that it’s not too long before we can resume meeting
Hong Yu Wong to Me (Direct Message) (16:32)
Indeed
March 22
Me to Hong Yu Wong (Direct Message) (16:33)
(Bit tired, lots of teaching to prepare, and looking after children tonight so listening out for chaos starting)
Hong Yu Wong to Me (Direct Message) (16:33)
How’s your teaching?
Me to Hong Yu Wong (Direct Message) (16:33)
Bit mixed. I’m enjoying it at leat
stduents maybe not so much
Hong Yu Wong to Me (Direct Message) (16:35)
Better you enjoy it than the students ;)
Me to Hong Yu Wong (Direct Message) (16:36)
How’s yours? Semester still going on
Hong Yu Wong to Me (Direct Message) (16:36)
Semesterferien
Phew
Me to Hong Yu Wong (Direct Message) (16:36)
nˆce
Hong Yu Wong to Me (Direct Message) (16:36)
Had enough of mediocre students and nasty colleagues
Played concerts last week at Sawallisch Stiftung
Me to Hong Yu Wong (Direct Message) (16:37)
mmmm
Joshua Shepherd to Everyone (16:38)
@hong yu… dunno. They are quick, and called reflexes (long-latency stretch reflexes, I’m thinking)
Hong Yu Wong to Everyone (16:39)
But they are cortically meditated and not peripheral…
Joshua Shepherd to Everyone (16:39)
true
Hong Yu Wong to Me (Direct Message) (16:48)
Completely agree with what you are pushing
Quite similar to what we were pushing earlier - am I right in thinking that?
EXACTLY
Yeah where is the MUST BE TRUE part coming from…
Me to Hong Yu Wong (Direct Message) (16:52)
Yes, I’m thinking about our project too
Me to Hong Yu Wong (Direct Message) (16:53)
I do think we can make trouble for Wayne and that he will want to resist some of the things we are defending
Hong Yu Wong to Me (Direct Message) (16:53)
definitely
Me to Hong Yu Wong (Direct Message) (16:54)
What I hadn’t properly appreciated before is that Wayne’s view seems to be committed to the non-existence of a distinctive mechanism of attention
Hong Yu Wong to Me (Direct Message) (16:54)
Oh
He emphasises that a lot
He and Chris Mole
Me to Hong Yu Wong (Direct Message) (16:56)
yes, but I always thought ‘is unnecessary’ whereas now I think if there were mechanisms then Wayne’s view would need revision .. but yes, should have been obvious to me before
Hong Yu Wong to Me (Direct Message) (16:56)
Wayne’s is more cleaned up version of the view of the Oxford attention psychologists, Mole’s is more driven by a priori and phenomenological considerations
Me to Hong Yu Wong (Direct Message) (16:56)
Ah tnaks
Me to Everyone (16:56)
be right back
Missed the start of Thor’s comment (sorry, Childrens) but yes
Hong Yu Wong to Me (Direct Message) (17:09)
Given what he’s said … the form of his argument in the chapter is completely misleading
Me to Hong Yu Wong (Direct Message) (17:09)
I’m wondering that too
Me to Hong Yu Wong (Direct Message) (17:09)
seems like there’s a background issue on what counts as knowing/understanding what attention is
And some appeal to folk psychology
Hong Yu Wong to Me (Direct Message) (17:09)
Yup
He’s fudging big time
Me to Hong Yu Wong (Direct Message) (17:10)
i like Thor’s question (caught end)
Lots of things or one? I think Wayne might just say that this is terminological on his view
Hong Yu Wong to Me (Direct Message) (17:10)
I think it’s too sceptical
Me to Hong Yu Wong (Direct Message) (17:10)
wayne too sceptical?
Hong Yu Wong to Me (Direct Message) (17:10)
Thor
Hong Yu Wong to Me (Direct Message) (17:11)
The Hommel point in the end I didn’t find helpful
Me to Hong Yu Wong (Direct Message) (17:11)
Right but if you accept Wayne, what blocks the scepticism?
Hong Yu Wong to Me (Direct Message) (17:11)
Because psychologists are happy to say anything
Diff forms of scepticism
Me to Hong Yu Wong (Direct Message) (17:11)
I think we’d say: if we find unification at the level of algo+representations then we’d have reason to resist thor
Wayne cannot
Hong Yu Wong to Me (Direct Message) (17:11)
YUP
exactly
It’s an open Q whether it is unified
Me to Hong Yu Wong (Direct Message) (17:11)
exactly
Hong Yu Wong to Me (Direct Message) (17:12)
He starts with unity as almost a presupposition
And now is backtracking
Haven’t seen you at these meetings before
Great to have you around
Denis denis.buehler@ens.fr to Everyone (17:12)
finger on that
Me to Hong Yu Wong (Direct Message) (17:12)
Right, and the unity thesis seems to come from the folk psychology or intuition part, so our stuff could really be relvant
Hong Yu Wong to Me (Direct Message) (17:13)
I just looked at your Mind paper yesterday - beautiful
Hong Yu Wong to Me (Direct Message) (17:13)
Yes this folk stuff is neither here nor there....
Me to Hong Yu Wong (Direct Message) (17:13)
oh thank you!
Me to Hong Yu Wong (Direct Message) (17:21)
In our terms I think a key question will be what if anything justifies conclusding that various operationalisations are operationations of one thing vs of several things … If I understand, Wayne has a kind of a priori approach to answering this question, whereas we seem to be arguing, in effect, that this kind of consideration is relevant but unlikely ever to be decisive
Hong Yu Wong to Me (Direct Message) (17:21)
yup
